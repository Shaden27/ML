Execution:
1)To execute notebooks, please upload all 6 datasets to your drive under /Datasets/ML.
2)For example, the enron1test.csv would look like /Datasets/ML/enron1test.csv.
3)The tests for all three datasets are hardcoded. For Na√Øve Bayes, you can run sample test cases in the last cell after training.
4)Execute code cell by cell. For logistic regression, you can skip cross validation by commenting the cross_validation() function and passing value of 	  lambda. (Executing without commenting the cross_validation() function may take up to 7 minutes)
5)For every model execution, a comment at the top of the cell will show what dataset and model is being used.
6)All questions are answered in Report.docx
