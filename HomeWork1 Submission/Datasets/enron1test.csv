i did some additional research regarding the sale to panenergy at meter 4045
on 2 / 27 and 2 / 28 . this sale was a brokered deal .
date purchase volume sale
2 / 27 & 2 / 28 phillips gas mkt . ( # 55397 ) 10 . 000 mmbtu panenergy marketing
( # 64749 ) 10 . 000 mmbtu
2 / 27 & 2 / 28 superior natural gas ( # 57065 ) 7 . 000 mmbtu panenergy marketing
( # 64749 ) 7 . 000 mmbtu
ect did not transport this gas away from meter 4045 . if this gas was
transported away from meter 4045 , it would have been a transaction between
panenergy marketing ( or whomever they sold the gas to at that point ) and
hpl . hope this information helps .

spam,"Subject: from mrs . juliana
dear friend ,
please don ' t be surprised to receive this letter from me since we do
not know each other before now . i am mrs . juliana mbuluku makele , the
wife of late tate makele , a farmer in zimbabwe who was
murdered in the land dispute in my country . i got your contact through
network online hence decided to write you .
before the death of my husband , he made a deposit with a security firm .
the consignment was declared to contain gem stones shipped on
diplomatic
cover to avoid customs detecting the actual contents . the actual
content is the sum of us 25 . 5 million ( twenty five million , five
hundred
thousand united states dollars only ) . this was done when he noticed
the
looming danger in zimbabwe on land policies . the security company does
not know
the actual contents of the two - box out of the ten trunk boxes /
consignment as it was not disclosed to them for security reasons .
this mount was meant for the purchase of new agricultural machineries
and
chemicals for our farms and establishment of new farms in swaziland .
this land problem came when zimbabwean president mr . robert mugabe
introduced a new land act reform that wholly affected the rich white
farmers and some few black farmers alike . this resulted to the killing
and mob action by zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the
society during political elections in my country . in fact a lot of
people
were killed because of this land reform act for which my husband was
one
of
the victims .
it is against this background that , all my family members fled
zimbabwe
for fear of our
lives . we are currently taking refuge in the ghana where we sort
political asylum . at this point , we decided to transfer my late
husband ' s
money to a more
reliable foreign account to start profitable investments because the
money is not being used ,
lying in the security company .
i must let you know that this transaction is
free from risk because i have all the necessary documents .
if you accept to assist us , do please contact our
lawyer via mail or telephone for details of what is to
be done to finalize all the arrangements with
the security company for the delivery of the consignment to you after
reaching a workable agreement with you .
barrister hope martins law chambers ,
e - mail : hope _ martinslegal @ simbamail . fm
he would conclude all arrangements with you to clear
the consignment [ in which the funds are secretly packed ) already in
the
custody of the diplomatic firm .
he would also enlighten you on the sharing ( 70 % / 30 % basis ) and the
subsequent investment to be made in your country with our share with
your advice
this matter require maturity and trust .
regards ,
mrs . juliana mbuluku

subject : reliant energy - entex transport imbalance
howard ,
this memo is regarding the 91 , 297 mmbtu imbalance that was created in april
of 1999 on
transport contract # 012 - 41991 - 02 - 004 . the transport delivery off hplc was
shorted to keep
entex whole on a minimum purchase from ena . originally this transport
imbalance was to be cleared
the next month in may of 1999 . some of the imbalance was cleared in may of
1999 , but 91 , 297 mmbtu
still remains as a imbalance on this contract . we need to monitor the ifhsc
index for the upcoming months
so that when one is compatible with the ifhsc index of april of 1999 we can
clear this imbalance . we will
need to allocated 91 , 297 mmbtu extra to the transport . this will reduce the
purchase from ena by 91 , 297
mmbtu for that month . i need you to watch over whoever is doing the reliant
energy - entex allocation to
make sure this happens .
thanks ,
michael"

international telephone services ( its ) is a telecommunications company born in 1995 and whose objective was to bring the most advanced technology in communications within the reach of its clients .
its started off offering a call - back service to a wide portfolio of foreigners on the costa del sol ( south of spain ) , then extending this to businesses also based in the area .
as of december 1998 , when full liberalisation occurred in the telecommunications market in spain , its focused its efforts on providing a made - to - measure service to each client at the best price and with a high level of quality . the company at this point offered primarily long distance national and international calls , prepaid calling cards , and intelligent numbers ( 90 x , 800 - type ) .
with the boom in the telecoms markets up to mid 2000 , its began to quote on the otcbb and began expanding its presence to other prime tourist locations in spain . unfortunately , the initiative did not have enough time to get traction before the dot . com bubble burst and with it dragged investor confidence in the rest of the telecommunications sector . by the end of 2001 , its downsized its operations and refocused its efforts on the south of spain in order to "" ride out the storm . ""
by january 2002 , actual shareholders , not happy with the financial or business results produced by the management at the time , and in the absence of a clear strategy to bring its back to the forefront of the competitive telecoms market in spain , decided to change the management team in order to bring in fresh ideas and an executive team capable of relaunching its as a serious contender and thereby increasing company value .
as of the end of march , its ' new ceo joined the company bringing with him a wealth of experience in the telecoms sector both in spain and north america .
since this time , the new ceo has put in place a new executive team consisting of a new cfo and coo as well as director of sales . these key positions have been filled with seasoned veterans from the telecoms and consulting areas which amongst these for bring over 80 years related work experience to the project .
in addition , the focus of the company is being changed from being a regionally focused reseller of services to an integrated telecommunications provider focused on the competitive packaging of services to specific market segments nationwide . some of these services will be resold and others will be developed by its , installed , maintained and supported by its , thus providing a differentiated advantage with respect to its traditional competitors . some of these services will be innovative services not yet offered in spain . another element to maximize the effectiveness of this new positioning is that the head office has been moved to madrid , spain ' s telecoms center .
the new its is positioning is focused on ensuring that every dollar of capital employed has a satisfactory return from its shareholders . as such , its is :
1 ) building very little "" owned "" infrastructure for commodity services , utilizing and integrating the vast amount of underutilized infrastructure of other existing operators .
2 ) investing in technologically innovative infrastructures and services .
3 ) investing in optimising its commercial dimensions .
the company has an excellent list of blue chip distribution partners , such as : corte ingles , respol ( petrol stations ) and carrefour ( 220 stores ) .
the cards are distributed at over 2000 outlets in spain , including 1 , 000 post offices .
the company has pending contracts with a u . s . military base in spain , 15 adventure and marine parks , and a large chain of convenience stores throughout spain .

this meter has not been disconnected . the measurement tech turned in a
temporary disconnect to mips ( about 2 months ago ) because the meter has not
flowed for approximately 4 months . this allows the measurement tech to forgo
testing the meter until it is ready to be put back in service . scheduled
volumes should be taken to zero until further notice .

the swift deal is not pathed correctly in pops . i set up an accounting
arrangement on the 012 - 41500 - 02 - 015 contract with the track id 80705 . would
you put the contract in pops with the associated track id ?
the transportation contract ( 012 - 41500 - 02 - 003 ) for the liquids replacement
gas is not pops . i looked in path manager and there is no deal for it
either . in december , the deal for this gas was 114096 . could you extend the
deal or get me the number for the new deal if there is one ? i need to set up
an accounting arrangement so i will need for you to verify the deal number
and transportation contract that this gas is supposed to go on . when i set
up the accounting arrangement i will let you know what the track id is so you
can put the contract at meter 9643 .
let me know when all of this is done so that i can reallocate the meter .

ham,"Subject: sitara position
please use the position manager home button .
when using the sitara position manager , and you drill down to view details
or change the dates , the position manager keeps
all your views running in the background . this feature allows you to use the
back and forward buttons to keep your views running .
on the downside , if you keep these views running but do not really intend to
go back to look at them , the system and your pc are working harder
to keep all the old views active and updated .
the home button sends you back to your default view - the first view you had
up when you hit apply . by clicking this button , your
position manager will clear out the old views the next time you drill in .
this is the only way to clear out the old views that you no longer need .
if you do not use the home key , and keep drilling in and changing the dates ,
the position manager is still keeping all the your views for
the day running in the backgound .
what we have found is by the end of the day , a user that does not clear out
the old views can have well over 30 views open , which is like having
30 position managers up on your pc . when that user closes down , the position
gets locked up for a while as it tries to clear out all the old views .
we will be making some changes soon to that should resolve this issue as far
as the sitara machine is concerned ; however , your pc may still be
slow with excessive unneccessary views open . we could make a change to
limit the number of active views you can have open , but at this time
i am not sure that is necessary ; regardless , in the mean time , please
remember to use your home button .
other helpful hints -
did you know you can shrink you tool bar ? tools options - uncheck show tool
bar text labels -
did you know you can split your position screen to have pipes on top and
zones and meters below ? tools options - show drill down second panel -
if you have an omicron position porfolio - your min / max button shows you
actual - and min / max for your day swing deals .

subject : mobil discrepancies
lee ,
here are some specific situations i am trying to resolve regarding volume on
centana :
purchase from mobil :
2 / 99 - the purchase by hplr for 155 , 000 mms in deal 60978 was never billed by
mobil .
( a purchase of gas in storage with no physical movement per comments in
sitara ) .
per our conversation friday , it sounds like hplc does owe mobil for his
gas , right ?
sale to mobil :
1 / 2000 - per the pipe statement provided by greg bonin for centana volumes ,
299 , 893
flowed in january . i billed 299 , 893 and mobil paid it .
logistics said 19 , 893 of the gas that flowed was not our sale to mobil
because
the gas wasn ' t scheduled . in addition , if the 19 , 893 were a sale to mobil ,
the
point would not be in balance in the system . the source of 280 , 000 of the
gas
says they only sold 280 , 000 mms and not any more . no other sources are in the
system .
i assume if the 19 , 893 wasn ' t consumed by mobil , they wouldn ' t have
paid for it . is there storage involved here ? if so , whose storage and how
did it work ?
there are sales in other months with discrepancies on centana with smaller
volumes
than in 1 / 2000 . once i understand what happened in january , maybe that will
help me
with the other months .
please let me know if there is any other information you need from me
relating to
the questions above and when would be a good time for you to discuss this . i
can bring
the pipe statements to you if that would help .

please be advised that contract no . teco 9121 shows in the global contract
system as pg & e texas pipeline , l . p . , however , the pipeline name should be
pg & e gas transmission teco , inc . . apparently , the pipeline name was entered
into the global system incorrectly . i have confirmed this with charles berner
in the contracts administration section and kim watson , both with pg & e gas
transmission teco , inc . . the contract name should be pg & e gas transmission
teco , inc .
i would like to change the pipeline to reflect the correct pipeline name
effective april 1 , 2000 . thus it will not affect the previous noms for this
contract .
all please respond to let me know if this will cause problems with
replication or anything else with the system .
julie and stacey , deal no . 47434 is attached to this contract you may need
to change this in your system .

explosive short term trading profits in a new technology
issue ( ticker : srge ) are being predicted as many
significant news releases indicate strong contractual
revenues with major telecom firms .
srge has been successfully working with telecommunications
giants ( with five million subscriber lines ) over the last 4
years , but is now projecting a banner expansion year with
geometric growth in revenues due largely to sales demands
for their innovative patented products and expansion into
international telecom markets .
surge technologies , inc . ( srge ) is a cutting - edge leader
that designs , develops , manufactures , and markets superior
patented outside plant electrical surge protection
equipment for the telecommunications industry .
the us sales projections for this market are $ 4 billion
annually , with this figure growing rapidly as the
expansion of new hdsl and adsl technologies permeate
the industry .
srge provides the telecom industry with the highest
quality protection element for complex digital switches .
protecting these telecom switching devices is crucial to
inclusive components that are sensitive to interruptions
in voltage which can cause extensive network damage , thus
negating costly and time - consuming repair and down - time .
major telecoms require this protection throughout their
network in order to prevent the hazards of harming
personnel , damaging expensive equipment , and massive
system failures .

couldn ' t get your hands on them or didn ' t have the right
information in time ? we are alerting you now to a special

of a breakout ! we are excited about srge ' s technology
and expansion as they prepare to ink deal after deal with
major us telecoms in conjunction with dramatic increases
in revenue for 2004 and 2005 . srge has made phenomenal
advancements but may be one of the few stocks left in
this industry group that is unknown and undervalued ,
therefore a 300 % - 400 % jump may wind up being conservative .

directly supporting eol , and your survey does not have an activity that you
can assign these times to , please contact me as soon as possible so we can
add the appropriate activities to your survey .
to fill out the survey :
at the top of the spreadsheet , you will see a box labelled "" select your rc "" .
click on the box and input your rc number , which will need to be 4 digits .
once you have done this , another box will appear with the message "" select
position from drop box ! "" you can then select the position ( i . e . , staff ,
specialist , etc . ) and "" ok "" . the choices for positions are based on
information contained in the org database ( i . e . , if a position is not listed

there was no flow at meter 981225 for the month of march . the hms technician
did contact measurement once to get the volumes zeroed out but apparently he
will have to get with them again . i have notified the tech and he is in the
process of doing this .
the meter is set on pressure control and the valve is open . gas control ' s
understanding and the field ' s understanding is that at the time the
brandywine deal ended some sort of standby agreement was in place . if this
is not the case please let me know and we will notify the plant and close the
valve .
robert ,
in the future if you have meters like this where there is a small flow
volume without a nomination in place please check with earl and myself so we
can investigate before we get commercial involved .

recap of pg & e texas meeting 4 / 12 / 00 .
volume issues :
? sherlyn schumack will provide stacey neuweiler with volume variances by day
and contract as soon as possible ( preferably the same day allocation is
received ) .
? stacey will notify sherlyn of correct volume or status if further research
is necessary as soon as possible .
? sherlyn will notify logistics , stacey , and lorraine of pg & e texas of
interconnect variances by day .
? each group will respond promptly to ensure payment can be made through the
system , eliminating manual line items on invoice .
? charlotte hawkins will see what was confirmed on the outstanding
interconnect issue for 2 / 00 , and daren or charlotte will make the necessary
correction .
rate issues :
? heidi withers will pull daily rates from pg & e texas bulletin board .
? greg steagall will provide heidi with service verification ( s ) and the daily
allocation summary received from pg & e texas during close , which shows rates
from pg & e texas .
? no action will be taken on rate variances where pg & e was paid per their
invoice . heidi has talked with brenda herod , and brenda is okay with this
course of action .
? there are four invoices from 1999 production where pg & e was underpaid , so
heidi and greg will work to correct those months to pay pg & e correctly .
there are no open invoices in settlements .
? it was noted that manual line items are not to be used to pay pg & e per
their invoice in the future . we expect to correct issues in the system prior
to the due date of the invoice unless there is a valid disagreement between
ena and pg & e . if ena has a valid disagreement , we will pay per ena  , s
verification .
daren has put in a request for legal to transfer the ena transport contracts
to hpl . this would eliminate stacey having to schedule the transport on ena
as well as the desk to desk deal . it would also prevent sherlyn from having
to allocate the transport expense contract and the brokered desk to desk
deal .
he has not had a response from legal yet ."

subject : houston gas & power controls / standards assessment
as you all are aware , there is a heightened awareness throughout the company
of the need for establishing global trading control standards and developing
a process by which we will track and monitor on a regular basis our success
at achieving those standards . i have been asked by sally to take the lead on
meeting this objective . for the last several weeks , i have been involved in
an extensive review of the london office controls and procedures for their
gas and power trading businesses . we have used the findings of this review
to start developing an assessment of controls , standards and measurement
methodology for the london office .
in order to work towards our goal of developing global trading standards
across enron , we need to perform the same controls and standards assessment
for the houston gas and power businesses ( we will assess global products and
other commodities traded at a later date ) . i will be in houston tuesday and
wednesday of next week to help facilitate this process .
i have scheduled a meeting next weds . , may 17 from 9 : 00 - 11 : 30 in eb 49 cl so
that we may review our controls , define the standards of meeting those
control requirements and assess the risk associated with those controls not
operating properly . before that meeting , i would like for all of you to
develop for your respective functional responsibilities the following :
- a listing of all controls your group is responsible for ( i . e . cash
collections are timely )
- a proposed standard that will ensure each control is being met to its
maximum effectiveness ( i . e . cash is collected within 30 days of deal date
with exceptions noted )
- a quantitative measure to allow performance monitoring of each standard
( i . e . % of cash collected within 30 days )
- a description of current capabilities to calculate , track and report each
measurement ( i . e . automated a / r aging report )
i would urge you to be as detailed as possible in listing your control
functions and to solicit feedback from your managers and leads . a lot of
work has already been done to identify this information so i would hope time
requirements for this will not be extensive . i have attached a worksheet to
be completed with the information discussed above . i have also attached a
high level summary of proposed gas and power standards to use a guideline but
it is certainly not all - inclusive and should be revised as necessary .
as discussed above , we will review the controls and standards listings for
each functional group in the weds . meeting and also assess the risk
associated with each control . i would like to achieve consensus on gas and
power operating standards for houston by the end of the meeting . let me know
if you have any questions or comments regarding this process . i look forward
to seeing you next week ."

transco has called wanting to know who is responsible for nominating devon ' s
pvr . we do not have access to their contracts to do
the noms . ces use to have transco do it for them and so did we for january
and february , but nothing was nominated for march or april . i
mentioned this to nelson and dan junek back in march , but nothing was
decided . at one time , devon did not want to give us access to nominate
their pvr because they did not want us to have access to any of their
information . could you find out if we are responsible for the pvr and if we
are , they
have to make us agent to nominate on those particular contracts ? maybe you
will have better luck than i did .

team ,
as i mentioned in our hpl staff meeting we are investigating the merits of
entering into a joint venture or another transaction structure that will
position hpl to effectively compete in the texas intrastate market . our
primary objective is to gain access to additional sources of gas supply and
achieve the required economies of scale to compete with other intrastate
pipelines . i would appreciate your confidence and support in developing the
optimal course of action for hpl and for enron .
the skills that we have developed in our group are critical to growing our
upstream origination business in n . america , as well as to the ongoing
operation of hpl . our origination strategy is to leverage our business
operations , field operations , engineering , producer services , and marketing
skills to capture value from transportation , gathering , storage and commodity
opportunities on the gas / power grids . we need our current employees to
accomplish this objective across n . america .
we have proven our ability to add value to enron by developing the
powder / wind river pipelines , installing electric compressors , contracting for
processing capacity , and establishing a new gas supply corridor along the
gulf coast . our recent efforts to provide services such as business
operations , measurement , trading / marketing , and accounting services to third
party producers and pipelines also looks to be a promising growth opportunity .
it is very important to our ongoing business relationships and our
competitive position in the market place that we do not discuss hpl related
matters with third parties . please come see me if you have any specific
questions or concerns . also please refer any third party inquiries regarding
hpl to tim determing .

in regards to meter 098 - 4179 the following information is what i have been
able to determine from the information available to me .
to your questions :
1 . cannot determine who owns this meter . i will contact molly carriere on
monday when she returns .
2 . hpl has a fifty ( 50 ) ft . easement at this location which does contain
language for appurtenance rights within the 50 ' .
3 . i pulled the meter file for this location which was prepared during
project rock and it does not contain a facility agreement so i am assuming
one was not located .
hope this helps .

attached is a contract preparation request for a facilities agreement for the
coastal oil the
legal department has prepared and is currently circulating a ratification and
consent to assign document to reflect this transaction .
we have been unable to locate an existing facility agreement for the 3
previously drilled wells and suspect that no such agreement exists .
the facility agreement requested herein is intended to cover only alterations
to be made to existing meter 098 - 4179 to install an h 2 s monitor and necessary
valving to allow hplc to accept gas from the newly drilled albrecht # 4 well .
once the h 2 s monitor has been installed and the albrecht # 4 well is ready to
flow , we intend to paper the purchase of gas from the albrecht # 4 well only
via a spot confirmation pursuant to a spot gtc . the albrecht # 4 will not be
covered by 96008903 , nor will the wells currently subject to 96008903 be
subject to the spot gtc .
coastal will reimburse hplc $ 39 , 600 for the cost of the installation .

we intend to attempt to connect about 4 , 000 mmbtu / d of new production from
the newly drilled coastal oil in may , 2000 , the meter flowed about 960
mmbtu / d of 3 . 36 % co 2 gas .
the content of the albrecht # 4 gas according to the field gas analysis
prepared by coastal oil the albrecht # 4 h 2 s content
is similar to that of the three wells currently producing 960 mmbtu / d behind
meter 098 - 4179 , the miller - albrecht unit # 1 - a and the hoff heller gas unit
# 1 a & # 2 d . coastal further purports that for some time now it ( and / or its
predecessor , mjg , corp . ) has treated these three wells for h 2 s in a manner
sufficient to reduce the h 2 s content delivered into hplc to permissible
levels . coastal has further indicated that it intends to reduce the h 2 s
content of the albrecht # 4 to permissible levels before delivering same to
hplc . in your opinion , should coastal be forced to install an h 2 s monitor
for this new gas prior to flowing same to hplc ?

ham,"Subject: ye 2000 global performance management begins 10 / 23 / 00
here ' s the latest global performance management schedule for ye 2000 and some
friendly reminder tips for you and your direct reports . the system is
scheduled to open for feedback in 35 days . please forward all mid - year 2000
evaluations to janet de la paz at eb 3658 a .
july 31 - oct 13 th development & testing
oct . 2 - 13 th training - hr community
oct 9 - 27 th training - all employees
oct 16 th system opens to hr community
oct . 23 rd system opens for feedback
nov . 17 th system closes for feedback
nov . 20 th prc meetings begin
dec . 15 th prc meetings conclude
jan 4 - 5 th executive committee meeting
reminders
request that employees maintain an updated list of their acheivements and
contributions to your group . tell them the information they forward to you
will better help you in representing them .
the focus of the prc this year will remain on development of the employee and
will emphasize comparing everyone within a particular peer group relative to
everyone else in their peer group .
update your documentation of employee performance and communicate the key
highlights of their performance or lack thereof now with your direct reports
so that the evaluation process creates minimal or no surprises for your
direct report . it is much easier to have a constructive evaluation session
with your direct report if he / she already knows what the key areas of needed
development are . an ideal situation for the supervisor is one in which
employees with performance issues ( can ' t do or won ' t do ) choose to exit the
group voluntarily before the self evident evaluation has to be given .
i will continue to provide updates and reminders as they become available .
let me know if you have any questions .

imbalances :
i would like us to continue to pursue channel / el paso / tenngasco for our
payback . they got our cashout number last week , where do they stand .
again , i think robert is an ally and i do not want to irritate him but
things will not get any better in the future . we need to resolve this
imbalance . can we net some of these contracts ?
i like mary poorman ' s report ; however i have questions :
how can we miss black marlin so completely ? do we agree with this imbalance ?
can we net all the chevron and dynegi contracts together for payback to
keith once we get the ar issue solved ?
where do we stand on the columbia energy resolution ?
where do we stand on the ngpl reconcilliation ?
duke energy 206 is still a problem .
do we need all these amoco contracts they have 8 , that seems like a large
number to me , can we net some of them ?
are we charging enough for the swing we get at the paper plant on the entex
contract ?
is there a way to keep tejas in line at southern union this winter ? that
meter will really swing then and i do not know how much line pack they have
the right to use .
can we net the corpus christi gas marketing and all the tejas / coral / gulf
energy / shell imbalances down ? how is the reconcillitation going ?
can we smash the entex and the reliant contracts together so we can get rid
of some of these contracts ? they have 9 , that seems like a lot to me .
gulfmark is gone down the road can we check with someone about this
contract , it seems like we should be able to net these volumes against some
where we are owed ?
is this lone star 213 imbalance real , if so how do we resolve ?
where did the exxon imbalance come from ?
do we need 5 texaco transportation contracts , can we get rid of some ?
can we combine the vastar and the southern imbalances ?
what is the webb / duval do , can we get rid of it , combine this with midcon ,
how old is this imbalnce ?
mick update the compressor fuel on the p / l but the new numbers do not seem to
translate up to the profit calculation ? can we do something about this ?
i thought the imbalance report i got this wed was pretty sad . some of the
columns did not add and there seemed to be a lot of missing information . can
we resolve this ?
i am concerned about our capacity positons in the future , we are going to
have to work on a better way to check our positions .
i had a meeting with tom shelton and our representative to the rrc , james
mann , the rrc is concerned about this winter and they have asked us to
compile a list of customers we will cut based upon the priority we filed with
the rrc several years ago . lauri will have a copy of the priority list . we
need to compile this list and get tom and james comfortable with the
process . the last thing we need is the rrc hammering on us , when can we get
this list ? i think we should be able to get something out of the contract
system . jackie morgan is who i would approach ."

we did take into account the price adjustments you made . the actual purchase
cashout for 8 / 00 was $ 118 , 103 . 67 . your pricing took care of most of the
cashout , but there was still a balance . the over delivery pricing per mmbtu
in the contract is the difference between hsc spot - 0 . 05 and hsc index , so
gd - 0 . 10 didn ' t quite cover the entire cashout . i have attached the calc

sandi ,
sorry for just now getting back with you . i was out last week .
the rate ( $ . 04 / mmbtu ) will be charged on the greater of the volumes nominated
on the supply contracts or the actual deliveries to the plant . the fee will
be adjusted yearly based on cpi .
bob - i could not remember if we stated the type of settlement on the
delivered volumes ( actuals or nominations ) . i think we should use actuals
due to possibility that the plant could over pull with out our knowledge on a
daily basis . we would receive the estimates / actuals on a lag and may have to
purchase gas to offset the imbalance , even though the plant kept the noms at
the 45 , 000 base . i also think that if the plant does increase the nom , they
are more likely to pull the additional volume rather than pulling less . do
you agree with this ?

since koch has told you that they sold the properties to duke , i would say
that duke should be paying us for the gas .
i had heard that koch sold the properties to another counterparty , but i
wasn ' t sure to whom . i either talked or left a message with someone in the
settlements area about two months ago about this after koch informed the
trader that they should not be getting the invoices . however , i never heard
back from anyone .
this is related to the ces acquisition which came online the first of this
year . the deal info we had at the time had this sale booked to koch . i can
change the tickets in sitara to the duke counterparty ( or create new tickets )
today if you need me to , so that we can get the invoice out the door . you
will still need to coordinate with the contract group in getting the correct
contract in place for the deal .

best to stick to moderately priced projects . the survey of
real estate agents from acorss the nation found that home
improvemnts in the $ 80 to $ 2 , 800 range yield the highest
rate of return when the home sells . the biggest return is on
simple lightening and brightening , which typicall costs
about $ 80 - $ 100 and gives an average return of 769 % on the
sale price . other big winners were cleaning and
de - cluttering ( cost = $ 305 - $ 339 ; ; return = 594 % ) , landscaping
and trimming ( cost $ 432 - $ 506 ; return = 266 % ) , and fixing ,

ham,"Subject: re : meter 984229 - roos common point - trade zone 18
vance :
per our conversation , we have two possible options to resolve this deal ,
depending on whether the wellheads are producing or not .
producing : if that is the case , the purchase from calpine , and any contracts
hedged to it will need to be backed up in the system to a wellhead level .
once that is done , i will need to research in the system how those wellheads
were allocated and paid and reallocate to your calpine deal . this will
probably have to go back to hplc ' s ownership of hplr ' s gathering assets .
non - producing : should we determine that the common point and any wells
behind it have been shut - in , or p & a ' d , we will need to reallocate this deal
to zero , and unwind any hedges against it ( or , move the hedges to another
deal , if possible . since the deal is older , we probably sold lower priced
contracts against the production and a buy - back today would possibly result
in a financial loss ) .
in either case , the deal needs to be cleaned up back to the date of last flow
at meter 4229 , which i am currently looking into . i will email you as soon
as i ascertain that date .
in lieu of the past couple of days , we may need to look at all of the deals
which were impacted by hplc ' s aquisition of hplr ' s gathering to ensure that
they are being captured properly , both at a book level and at a state filing
level . please let me know what your thoughts are as to how to accomplish
this .

mary ,
hplc meter number 0984229 was physically remove from service in december ,
1999 . typically , before hpl physically pulls a meter , production has ceased
at minimum for 6 months or the production has been released . in the case of

subject : re : meter 984229 - roos common point - trade zone 18
vance :
per our conversation , we have two possible options to resolve this deal ,
depending on whether the wellheads are producing or not .
producing : if that is the case , the purchase from calpine , and any contracts
hedged to it will need to be backed up in the system to a wellhead level .
once that is done , i will need to research in the system how those wellheads
were allocated and paid and reallocate to your calpine deal . this will
probably have to go back to hplc ' s ownership of hplr ' s gathering assets .
non - producing : should we determine that the common point and any wells
behind it have been shut - in , or p & a ' d , we will need to reallocate this deal
to zero , and unwind any hedges against it ( or , move the hedges to another
deal , if possible . since the deal is older , we probably sold lower priced
contracts against the production and a buy - back today would possibly result
in a financial loss ) .
in either case , the deal needs to be cleaned up back to the date of last flow
at meter 4229 , which i am currently looking into . i will email you as soon
as i ascertain that date .
in lieu of the past couple of days , we may need to look at all of the deals
which were impacted by hplc ' s aquisition of hplr ' s gathering to ensure that
they are being captured properly , both at a book level and at a state filing
level . please let me know what your thoughts are as to how to accomplish
this .
thank you again for all of your hard work in this area ,

nick ,
i understand that they terminated their agreement . however , i don ' t feel
that we can confiscate their production . we need to either pay them for the
gas , or cut a deal to redeliver a like volume to them at another meter .
given the decrease in prices from september to current and prompt month , i
would guess that they want to be paid . we won ' t know that until we call
them . i don ' t know where the responsibility lies as far as calling to
explain to them that we took delivery of their gas until the meter was
shut - in .
please let me know if i can do anything further to assist .

refurbs save cash ! why hesitate getting the best
value by getting the exact same equipment , with original
manufacturers warranty at a much lower price .
q :
what
is considered factory refurbished ?
a : there are lots of
things that can label items factory refurbished . some are so
frivolous , its laughable . but because consumer laws prevent
manufacturers from selling anything considered factory refurbished
as "" new "" , the second consumer gets the best deal . here are a few
examples :
manufacturers /
distributors are not allowed to export outside their territory /
country .
to avoid
"" disturbing "" the dealer / reseller channel in different
countries , manufacturers and distributors cannot export the
product , as new and therefore label it as refurb .
most major retail
superstores offer a 30 - day money back guarantee on their
products and there are those consumers that just simply take
advantage of that . these items are returned to the manufacturer ,
inspected and repackaged like new .
items where the
box or casing was damaged in shipment , which are returned to the
manufacturer .
the item was
returned to the manufacturer because of a slight defect . the
part that was defective was replaced by the manufacturer , tested
and then repackaged just like new .
the item was
returned because of a minor cosmetic blemish on the casing that
was corrected .
demonstration
units are also considered factory refurbished . these units are
inspected , tested and repackaged .
the box was simply
opened . thats it !
brand new
overstocked items are also labeled factory refurbished .
all factory
refurbished products are inspected serviced by the
manufacturer then tested and repackaged to meet original product
specifications . all
merchandise is warranted by the original manufacturer

ham,"Subject: txu lone star
i am working on clearing an old txu lone star / gas distribution balance from
8 / 99 and 9 / 99 . we originally billed txu on nominated quantities and they
have shortpaid us due to meter adjustments . these are brokered deals where
we sold to txu and purchased from exxonmobil and highland . txu has provided
meter support since the deals were on lone star pipeline , however , i am
unsure how to have volume management reallocate .
for example , we originally sold 10 , 000 mmbtu on 8 / 3 / 99 to txu and purchased
1 , 200 mmbtu from highland energy and 8 , 800 mmbtu from exxonmobil . txu shows
the total amount of gas on 8 / 3 / 99 was 9 , 240 mmbtu . how should the purchase
piece be allocated between exxonmobil and highland since this was a brokered
deal ?
august 1999 :
sale
txu electric & gas deals # 104975 , 104256 , 104738
lone star gas co . deal # 101985
purchase
exxonmobil corp . deal # 101522
highland energy co . deal # 101530
september 1999 :

exxonmobil corp . deals # 101522 , 108564

please let me know if i need to speak with someone else about this . thanks

jackie ,
your allocation is correct with the exception of days 10 / 6 and 10 / 19 where
strangers gas is allocated . i have created an accounting arrangement for
these days and the new track id for ena is 240384 . please allocate the ena
portion according to rays schedule for these 2 days . deal 422516 ( purchase
from dynegy ) needs to be extended for these 2 days so i can do an accounting
arrangement . alfonso i need for you to allocate your meter daily , because
we have tiered pricing this month .
thanks ."

just wanted to thank everybody who works with mobil beaumont refinery .
our former three year deal with them expired september 30 . last week , we
( finally ) executed a new contract that keeps hpl as their largest natural gas
supplier through september 30 , 2002 . also , when their volumes go up in early
2001 , they will once again be hpl ' s single largest industrial customer .
everybody ' s hard work in keeping this customer happy has paid off . although
they can be very demanding to work with ( particularly now that they are part

subject : tenaska iv gas
daren , per review of the gas agreements between tenaska iv and
williams / apache and our understanding of the agency agreement , i had a few
items i wanted to discuss with you ( in lieu of our meeting today that was
cancelled ) :
1 . looking at the october gas supply to the plant , i think tenaska iv should
have been charged at the contract prices with williams & apache ( i . e . 2 . 285 )
and not at what the final price that was actualized per megan ' s summary -
230 , 406 at $ 710 , 616 . 70 , price of $ 3 . 084 . if this volume was charged at
2 . 285 the total would have been $ 526 , 477 . 71 , a difference of $ 184 , 138 . 99 .
2 . looking at the november gas supply to the plant , tenaska iv was charged
$ 2 . 91 per mmbtu , instead of $ 2 . 285 for volumes of 267 , 300 . at the $ 2 . 91
price , the total settlement price was $ 777 , 843 instead of $ 610 , 780 . 50 at
2 . 285 , showing a difference of $ 167 , 062 . 50 .
i reviewed the gas supply agreements and the williams gas price ( pg . 19 ) for
2000 gas is 2 . 32 , which can be adjusted by the waha transportation adjustment
if delivered at waha . this adjustment started in 1997 at $ . 03 per mmbtu and
increase by 5 % per year . thereby currently , the adjustment factor is at
. 0347 , giving us a price of $ 2 . 2853 per mmbtu .
in reviewing the apache gas agreement ( pg . 22 ) , i noticed that the gas price
is 2 . 285 at waha & 2 . 315 at katy / carthage for 2000 . per review of the apache
invoices , it appears that we are not getting our gas at these points but at
other places ( i . e . lomak - sterling & mendell cdp ) at a price of $ 2 . 175 . if
enron has a separate agreement at these delivery points and can capture a
margin difference then that is upside to enron . however , i think the plant
should not be charged above the contract price of $ 2 . 285 .
looking at the daily gas that was scheduled to the plant for november and
october , i did not see that their use went over the contracted volumes from
williams and apache of 45 , 000 mmbtu per day . therefore i don ' t think spot
prices are part of the equation here . additionally , i recall from our
meeting last month that all enron makes on this deal is the agency fee of
$ . 04 per mmbtu ( excluding the margin difference that enron has on apache gas
delivery points if my scenario above is correct ) .
so based upon items 1 & 2 above , i am suggesting that tenaska iv adjust their
november invoice owed to enron for gas used by the plant by the gas price
differences showed above . therefore , i am planning to wire a payment of
$ 484 , 234 . 03 ( see breakout below ) on friday , 12 / 22 , to enron on behalf of
tenaska iv texas partners , ltd . for this activity .
month plant gas price amount
november 267 , 300 2 . 91 $ 777 , 843
november adjustment $ ( 167 , 062 . 50 )
october adjustment $ ( 184 , 138 . 99 )
nov . agency fee 1 , 350 , 000 . 04 $ 54 , 000
sept . agency fee 98 , 813 . 04 $ 3 , 592 . 52
total $ 484 , 234 . 03
i discussed these issues with mike mazowita , rick hill & jody pierce before
reaching this conclusion . should you have any different ideas or thoughts
that i am not covering , please call me at 3 - 7280 and we can discuss . thanks .

subject : basin production from ga 213
i have reviewed the gas composition analysis from spl of the basin production
from ga 213 . while spl ' s analysis does show a dewpoint of around 20 degrees
f at 400 psig , it is both my and john handley ' s opinion that the gas from the
wellbore had stratified by the time that this sample was taken . we expect
the dewpoint of the flowing gas to be higher . however , this was the best
sample that could be obtained at the time . we have conferred with steve
schneider and we are willing to take this gas on a conditional basis over the
next couple of days . once the 6 "" line has been pigged , the production flows
stablilized and mitchell ' s conditioning equipment lined out over the next
couple of days , hms will need to take another sample at the meter run and
have spl run an extended analysis with a dewpoint curve on an expedited
basis . should this sample indicate a dewpoint over 45 degrees f , then this
production will be shut in again until hydrocarbon dewpoint conditioning
equipment has been installed . in the meantime , hms needs to keep a close
watch on all southern union city gates on galveston island to monitor for
liquids fallout ."

per our recent discussions , please evaluate the above gas stream for
reconnection into hpl . this gas is presently being produced into dow
pipeline . an existing , three - inch meter tube is in place , and the gas can be
switched by opening and closing existing valves ? a copy of a recent gas
analysis has been provided . the expected gas flow is 9000 to 10 , 000 mcf / d .
mr . matt johnson with wagner hence , enhanced production . i would
attempt to obtain at least a year ' s commitment of this gas from wagner &
brown . mr . johnson did not want to flow this gas for march since the
three - inch run could not handle the total volume , and he did not want to
split the flow . operational logistics were also questionable ( compression ,
etc . ) . if you need further info , please advise . thanks . jab"

traders ' monthly alert
january pick ( bmxg ) exploded from . 20 to 2 . 07 ,
a gain of over 900 % in 6 days ( 1 / 18 - 1 / 24 ) !
our next pick is an incredible find that will
outperform all others based on their solid
numbers , huge sales backlog , $ 2 billion in
financing , low outstanding shares , and a deal
with chinese government - run companies totaling
$ 10 billion !
urgent buy at any price :
global environmental energy corp .
otcbb - geec
current price - 1 . 90
running to - 6 . 00
geec is cbs marketwatch . com ' s # 1 best performer in the dj
diversified industrials index in the last 2 months . this
is a dow jones industry index that also contains 3 m , ge ,
and honeywell .
we are sending this urgent investor bulletin revealing the
most undervalued pick on the otcbb to our millions of
subscribers for substantial profits immediately !
geec has experienced a recent spike in price and volume
indicating heavy accumulation of shares . this is a sign of
even bigger things to come for this emerging world leader
in the conversion of waste materials into electrical energy ,
an industry with such high global demand that it is impossible
to assign a value to the size of the market .
geec is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of their
biosphere process system for the disposal of a wide variety
of waste products at 5 to 7 tons per hour , making a major
impact on the global waste problem . this profitable and
environmentally safe process converts into clean , green
electricity such waste materials as municipal solid waste ,
agricultural wastes , forestry wastes , medical wastes ,
industrial wastes , sewage sludge , shale oil , sour natural
gas , and the huge market of used tires .
geec generates 5 to 10 mega - watts per hour of electricity
from the waste conversion on a continuous basis which is
then sold to replenish the local or national grid .
the biosphere process succeeds in filling an urgent worldwide
need for cost - effective renewable energy sources and a
corresponding universal need to solve critical problems in the
disposal of waste . geec has secured international acceptance
for a revolutionary product designed to significantly impact
the global waste problem while a major push for generating
electricity from alternative sources continues to be the hot
topic due to shortages and massive power failures .
geec just announced a $ 10 billion , 5 - year joint venture with
chinese government - operated companies , including yanzhou coal
mining ( nyse - yzc , $ 74 ) . the deal is structured to have 1 , 300
geec biosphere systems deployed throughout china to fulfill
an urgent need for waste disposal and energy generation , two
critical areas for a country with a population exceeding 1 . 3
billion people . as china ' s rapid economic advance continues ,
a shortfall of 500 million kilowatts exists annually , prompting
periodic blackouts in all chinese provinces . geec is in line
to profit substantially while providing relief from unmanageable
municpal solid waste disposal and simultaneously helping china
meet its energy needs .
the forecast for geec is crystal clear , and this is just the tip
of the iceberg for this emerging worldwide leader where shares
should be added immediately to every portfolio . we expect a
continuous flow of huge news announcements while shares still
represent an uncommon value for a company of this caliber . look
for the continuation of strong positive developments that will
ignite geec , which earns our highest rating for the most
explosive gains on wall street .

ham,"Subject: california energy crisis
california ' s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last several months . unfortunately , this debate has generated more heat than light . we want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis . please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation and our position on california energy issues .
what happened in california
the source of california ' s current problem is as straightforward as supply and demand . california ' s economy grew 29 percent since 1998 . this increased the demand for electricity by 24 percent . at the same time , regulatory restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state . so demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added . the result , predictably , is a shortage . this summer , peak capacity will be about 10 percent shy of peak demand , leading to further blackouts in the state .
in addition to the supply and demand imbalance , there are two other related factors that led to the current crisis . first , the state ' s regulations forced all sales and purchases into the spot market . the spot market for power is extraordinarily volatile . the way firms behave in a free market when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases long term , medium term and short term , to reduce exposure to this volatility . in california , state regulation prevented this strategy . this would be the equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in the most volatile interest rate environment imaginable . everything was fine while the power surplus persisted , but when shortages ensued , every megawatt was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price .
second , retail markets were not deregulated . regulated retail rates remained in effect , and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep competition out . this meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesale prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the regulated retail rate . they are now nearly bankrupt .
in short , california ' s problems were caused by regulation , not deregulation . regulations prevented competitors from entering the market , prevented new generation from being built , and prevented prudent hedging against volatile spot prices .
at the time california was developing its restructuring plan , enron warned the state ' s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives , which , if adopted , would have averted the current crisis .
enron ' s role
many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than fix the problem . power sellers , including enron , have been vilified by the politicians and the media . here are the facts :
? other than a small amount of wind power , enron is not a generator in the state of california . every megawatt we sold in california we bought in the same market available to other california purchasers . because we are a market maker , not a generator , we are not biased toward high prices . we are interested only in having a market that works so that we can package products for our customers .
? as a seller to end - use markets in the state , we provided protection from the problems the states ' utilities , and their customers , now face . we protected , and still protect , our customers from price volatility .
you may have read that ees recently elected to have the utilities supply power directly to its customers in california instead of procuring power on the open market . early reports mischaracterized this as a "" turnback "" of our customers to the utilities . here are the facts :
? as a result of a variety of factors existing in the current california market , it made more sense for ees to source power for its customers directly from the utilities . this decision reduced ees ' s market price risk by allowing ees to access lower utility rates .
? ees did not terminate any customer contracts , and our customers continue to receive the financial benefits of their contract prices .
? ees is continuing to work with its california customers to provide them with other energy - related products and services , including assistance in reducing the demand for power , particularly at peak times .
enron is currently proposing solutions to help california work out of its crisis ; enron continues to sign up customers in the state ; and enron continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in western power markets . enron ' s primary business is managing risk for our customers with solutions customized to meet their needs . there has never been more demand for our products and services .
the solution
the solution to california ' s crisis is also straightforward . in summary , the state must increase supply , reduce demand , reduce reliance on the spot market and shore up the financial stability of the state ' s utilities .
increasing supply
california ' s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing short of byzantine . enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in less than a year . in california , it often takes 5 to 7 years . california simply must streamline this process . ironically , while many of the regulations generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality , the regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and displacing current plants , which emit 40 times as much nox . california can have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new facilities .
reducing demand
customers in california today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand . they pay the same rate no matter what the market price is . an open retail market would trigger demand responses , which would balance supply and demand at lower prices than today . california should fully open its retail market .
reducing reliance on the spot market
in a truly deregulated market , customers would protect themselves from volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer term , fixed - price basis . the state has instead left procurement in the hands of the utilities , which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market . opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over their price risk .
restoring the financial integrity of the state ' s institutions
the utilities in california are not paying their bills . this has led to greater uncertainty in the market , higher costs , and reduced flexibility to arrive at lasting solutions . california must permit its utilities to recover their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is needed .
just as important as doing these things , the state must avoid policies that , while politically attractive , do not fix the problem or even make matters worse . price caps have been proposed . they don ' t work ; have never worked ; and they will not work here . price caps succeed only in creating shortages , which then have to be allocated among competing users . imagine how ineffectively the government would be in determining , for example , whether it is better to make its limited power supplies available to the imperial valley or silicon valley . price caps are a surefire way to make the current shortage worse .
the state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in california . there is no reason to believe , and every reason to doubt , that the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in , constructing , operating and maintaining assets . this will also result in california tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power generation - - which the private sector can do - - instead of education , roads and other public goods - - which the private sector cannot do .
as you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about the crisis from the media , it ' s important for you to know this : we at enron will continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real solutions to the state ."

friday 3 / 23 - received a page from silver in gas control at 8 : 00 pm regarding
the gulf plains plant . they were cut into another pipeline ( tennessee ) , and
wanted to overdeliver to us by 10 m for the night . larry zammit paged 8 : 05
pm , reiterated same . we agreed to take the additional volume for the
remainder of the evening only .
saturday 3 / 24 - 7 : 30 am , received page from lee in gas control regarding the
gulf plains plant , apparently they felt that they may need to overdeliver for
saturday ' s gas day as well . phoned larry zammit and spoke with him regarding
the situation at the plant , he indicated that there may have been a
miscommunication or misunderstanding at the plant . larry phoned the plant
and made sure that they were on board to keep us balanced and not overdeliver
to , or swing on , hpl .
2 : 00 pm - phoned lee in gas control to see how the pipeline was doing . he
indicated that we were pretty tight , but would probably make it without
utilizing any oba ' s .
sunday - so . union requested 15 m beginning at 11 : 00 am . the pipeline was
tight again , but gas control was okay ."

the oi | and gas advisory
now that oil and gas has entered a long - term buil market ,
our speciaity in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
undervalued energy piays has produced soaring returns .
emerson oi | and gas ( eogi ) is an energy developer in the us oil beit
and in canada ' s most highly coveted reservoirs with generating
potentia | of miilions per week .
breaking news ! ! !
emerson oi | and gas identifies lease opportunity in south texas
providing opportunity
for 22 - well re - entry in fieid with strong producing history and large
recoverabie reserves
south texas in a | arge existing fieid that was discovered and driiled
by major oil companies
in the 1970 s . the field is estabiished with substantia | recoverable
reserves , estimated at over
3 . 9 miilion barreis of oil and about 2 biilion cubic ft . of gas in the
two pay zones .
symbo | - eogi
price - . 065
the value of eogi ' s shares wi | | skyrocket :
1 . price charts confirm oi | prices are experiencing the strongest buil
market in a generation .
2 . natural gas prices have tripied in the | ast two years .
3 . with multiple projects in high - gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth muiti - miliions , eogi is seliing for | ess than 1 / 4 the
vaiue of its assets .
4 . emerson oi | and gas specializes in using new technoiogy to turn
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitabie enterprises .
aiready shares in the oi | and gas sector are rising faster than the
overail market . in fact , four of dow jones ' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy related . but it ' s in the mid - sized
explorers and deveiopers | ike emerson ( eogi ) that the biggest gains are
being made . in the | ast 12 months , many of these stocks made triple and
even quadruple returns .
our subscribers need to pay particularly ciose attention to undervalued
eogi shares , because it won ' t be a bargain for | ong . this smail company
with a comparably sma | | market value , is sitting on a bonanza of oil
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especiaily with
the daily jump in energy prices .
but a | | that wi | | change in a few short weeks , as these reserves move
into production , bringing an explosion of cash that is expected to
capture the attention of the market , and have an equa | | y expiosive
effect on the share price .
what will the cash fiow from these projects do for the price of emerson
oil and gas ' shares ? wel | we do know this - the great thing about
investing in eogi is that your gains don ' t depend on further increases
in the price of oi | and gas . even if energy prices stay fiat , or
deciine
slightiy , you will stil | make a very heaithy return . of course , energy
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
or so as predicted , meaning the value of eogi ' s assets and earnings
wil |
soar even higher . in that case , the reward for investors wi | | be
staggering .
overal | , we consider eogi to be one of the | ast outstanding energy
piays in the oi | and gas sector . once this discovery has been realized ,
eogi shares wil | surge sharpiy on heavy investor attention . we have
identified this discovery for immediate accumuiation . eogi ' s oil and
gas reserves are well estabiished and are going into massive
production .
eariy investors wiil secure optimum gains , and any additiona | news in
this
area wil | reaily turn up the heat , causing us to revise our targets
upward in next week ' s bu | | etin .

our cold box will probably not have feed into it until mid may at the earliest .
this means that we will continue to have a large volume of refinery gas going to

the month well short of the 80 with the volumes increasing as the month
progresses and the cold box comes on line . call me if you have any questions .

the latest is that if they want to keep their phones , they need to fill out a contract changing the liability to them .
we will have some in our office tomorrow around 1 ( ran out today ) and they can also pick one up at a cingular store . just make sure that they mail them back to me .
my home address is : 4501 shetland houston 77027
as for the cancellation of the corporate phones , that is not scheduled to take place yet , and may not right away .
if they just want to do a rate plan change , then they can do it via email ( have them email me ) or they can indicate it on their contract that they fill out to change liability .
the main thing to do is to fill out the contract to change liability , which also obligates them for one year .
as for the balances accrued up to date , they are not responsible for those . enron is .
good luck to you . i hope you get my email and i hope i get to see you again .
and , yes , i will be getting all new accounts now !

we will be killing about 2000 deals in sitara tonight . whenever a deal is touched in sitara , it will bridge over to unify . these are desk 2 desk deals , and should have minimal impact on you ."
ham,"Subject: northern natural gas
yesterday , enron settled a procedural dispute with dynegy over northern natural gas . our settlement allows dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline , dismisses their texas lawsuit and extends enron ' s right to repurchase until june 30 . we reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring enron out of bankruptcy . while we would like to keep northern natural , we still have some 9 , 000 miles of safe , profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses .
the settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our $ 10 billion damage claim against dynegy . it also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts .
we want to see a positive future for the employees working with northern natural gas . below is a copy of a message from stan horton further explaining this decision to the employees of enron transportation services .
ken
dear ets colleague :
on thursday , enron entered into a settlement over dynegy ' s exercise of its option to acquire the northern natural gas pipeline . the settlement allows dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while enron pursues its damage claim against dynegy .
in this respect , enron corp . has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of northern natural gas . consequently , enron corp . has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of northern natural gas to dynegy , while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved .
the company has concluded that with this settlement , enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly , as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court . for the northern natural gas employees , i believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day - to - day satisfaction of running a valuable , successful business .
beginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe , reliable and efficient operation of northern natural gas .
over many years we have run high quality , cost conscious and profitable businesses in ets . keep up the good work !

ham,"Subject: cleburne issues
daren , with megan gone i just wanted to touch base with you on the status of the enron payments owed to the cleburne plant . the current issues are as follows :
november gas sales $ 600 , 377 . 50
october payment to ena for txu pipeline charges $ 108 , 405 . 00
cleburne receivable from enron $ 708 , 782 . 50
less : november gas agency fees ( $ 54 , 000 . 00 )
net cleburne receivable from enron $ 654 , 782 . 50
per my discussions with megan , she stated that about $ 500 k of the $ 600 k nov gas sales was intercompany ( desk to desk ) sales , with the remainder from txu . are we able to settle any intercompany deals now ? are we able to settle with txu ?
additionally , you ' ll see that i included the oct txu payment in the receivable owed to cleburne also . this is because i always pay megan based upon the pipeline estimates in michael ' s file , even though they are not finalized until the next month . therefore in my november payment to enron , i paid ena for october ' s estimate , of which megan would have paid the final bill on 12 / 26 / 01 when it was finalized . however , i had to pay the october bill directly last month , even though i had already sent the funds to ena in november . therefore , i essentially paid this bill twice ( once to ena in nov & once to txu in dec ) . i deducted the november agency fees from these receivable totals to show the net amount owed to cleburne .
please advise as to the status of these bills . you can reach me at 713 - 853 - 7280 . thanks .
