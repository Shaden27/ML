subscribers for substantial profits immediately !
sales orders received by leth exceed $ 150 million over the past year
while major news was just released that adds multi - millions to the bottom
line . leth has experienced a recent spike in price and volume indicating
heavy accumulation of shares which is a sign of even bigger things to come
for this emerging world leader in the conversion of waste materials into
electrical energy , an industry with such high global demand that it is
impossible to assign a value to the size of the market .
( mar 9 ' 04 ) urgent news update :
leth announces the sale of two ( 2 ) biosphere process systems to
procura international limited for $ 14 million with an option for the sale of
an additional 98 systems over the next 24 months .
solving a dual crisis - waste and energy :
leth is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of their biosphere
process system to generate revenue from the disposal of a wide variety of
waste products at 5 to 7 tons per hour which makes a major impact on the
global waste problem . this profitable and environmentally safe process
converts into clean , green electricity such waste materials as municipal
solid waste , agricultural wastes , forestry wastes , medical wastes , industrial
wastes , sewage sludge , shale oil , sour natural gas , and the huge market of
used tires . leth profits from the sale of electricity created from the waste
conversion on a continuous basis by generating 5 to 10 mega - watts per hour
of electricity which is then sold to replenish the local or national grid .
( mar 3 ' 04 ) leth release major product delivery and net profit news
leth delivered 12 biosphere process systems which resulted in a net profit
of $ 3 . 5 million , the equivalent of . 12 cents per share . leth is scheduled to
receive an additional $ 7 million translating into an additional . 24 cents per
share which is the balance of this completed contract over the next 6 months .
the net profit per share from just this single contract would value the stock
above $ 6 by calculating the . 36 cents per share total at an average industry
pe of 18 - 22 .
examining leth - by the numbers
total assets : 36 . 8 million = 1 . 26 per share of assets
cash : 23 . 4 million = . 80 cents per share of cash
shares outstanding : 29 million ( down from 31 . 8 million ) after 2 . 8 million
shares retired in feb . ' 04
additional shares to be retired : 1 . 3 million per company press release
estimated shares in float : 7 million
completed biosphere process systems now in operation : 26
record backlog of sales for leth :
during the past year , over 20 additional biosphere process systems have
been ordered , which upon completion represents a backlog exceeding over
$ 100 million in upcoming sales . many of these contractual agreements
include options for the purchase of additional biosphere systems in the
future once the initial order has been completed . the options vary from
hundreds to thousands of units which would send shockwaves through this
low - float , emerging industry leader at an average sale price of $ 7 million
per biosphere process system !
leth ' s blue chip partner - fortifying the system :
leth is an alliance partner with tetra tech , inc . ( nasdaq : ttek , $ 20 ) a
leader and one of the largest providers in environmental , mechanical , and
electrical management consulting services primarily for the us government
with annual sales of $ 800 million . tetra tech will coordinate the securing of
necessary permits , installation , and continuous worldwide monitoring of the
biosphere process system for leth . tetra tech is now in the process of
obtaining department of environmental quality permitting for the
biosphere process in the state of louisiana . this is a monumental event for
leth which opens the floodgates for major project revenues in louisiana
while having a parallel effect on leth stock in the form of a huge near -
term announcement .
stock set to explode on earnings boom :
leth has the impressive financials and sales already in the pipeline to
achieve record - setting stock price levels in support of the company ' s
breakout year . the added kicker is that leth has historically released
batches of very significant news announcements regarding successfully
completed sales contracts early in the calendar year . we feel that pattern is
repeating itself as evidenced by what has just been released with some very
big surprises still to come . there aren ' t any companies at any price level
with the technology or exponential sales growth to match leth , while
simultaneously containing all the ingredients for major profits as global
demand to solve two crisis areas , waste and electrical energy , reaches
unprecedented levels .

spam,"Subject: frustration and hopelessness
dear friend .
i am hajia mariam abacha the wife of the formal head of state the
federal republic of nigerian late general sani abacha .
following the sudden death of my husband general sani abacha the late
former head of state of nigeria in june 1998 , i have been thrown into a
state of utter confusion , frustration and hopelessness by the present
civilian administration , i have been subjected to physical and
psychological torture by the security agents in the country .
i have lost confidence with anybody within the country . you must have
heard over the media reports and the internet on the recovery of
various huge sums of money deposited by my husband in different
security firms abroad , some companies willingly give up their secrets
and disclosed our money confidently lodged there or many out right
blackmail .
in fact the total sum discovered by the government so far is in the
tune of $ 700 . million dollars . and they are not relenting to make me poor for life .
i got your contacts through my personal research , and out of desperation
decided to reach you . i will give you more information as to this regard
as soon as you reply . i repose great confidence in you hence my
approach to you due to security network placed on my day affairs i cannot afford to visit the embassy so that is why i decided to contact you and i hope you will not betray my confidence in you . i have deposited the sum of 35 . 3 million dollars ) with a security firm abroad whose name is with held for now until we open communication .
i shall be grateful if you could receive this fund into your account
for safe keeping . this arrangement is known to you my lawyer and my son
mohammed abacha alone who have just been released by the federal government , so my lawyer will deal directly with you as security is up my whole being .
i am seriously considering to settle down abroad in a friendly
atmosphere like yours as soon as this fund get into your account so that i can start all over again if only you wish , but if it is impossible , just help me in diverting this fund into your account which will accrue you 30 % of this fund . please honesty is the watch word in this transaction .
i will urgently require for your very private number or cell if any .
in case you don ' t accept please do not let me out to the security as i
am giving you this information in total trust and confidence
i will greatly appreciate if you accept my proposal in good
faith . please expedite action . and do get back to me immediately .
sincerely yours
hajia mariam abacha

undervalued market report for largest percentage
gain leaders
opening price : 2 cents
immediate target : 10 cents in 10 days
near - term proj . high : 25 cents
current market value ( approx ) : 1 . 5 million
* * our picks are on fire ! * *
our last pick for huge percentage gains ( gdls ) soared from
. 23 to . 83 ( 261 % on 3 / 29 ) immediately following our report .
we believe the gains for aret will run circles around all
our other picks for the year .
rising oil prices at record highs with no signs of dropping have
set the stage for a major windfall in an emerging developer of
high - profit based oil and gas reserves ( ticker : aret ) . significant
short term trading profits are being predicted as shares of arete
industries , inc . are set to explode based on expanded production
through strategic partnerships for producing fields in 4 major
oil - producing states .
aret just released major news and we believe there is much more
to follow . there is strong evidence of big block buying indicating
that an explosive move is coming on a huge near - term announcement .
as recently reported , aret is executing the launch of a $ 1 billion
financed master energy fund which is capped at $ 100 million
increments to fund the company ' s energy projects . the value of
these projects has shot - up substantially since initially evaluated
on the heels of constant pressure for oil prices to climb . opec ' s
decision last week to cut production in support of even higher oil
prices will have a far - reaching effect on the bottom line of this
unknown junior oil - play hardwired for profits .
aret has maintained a leading role in each project thus enabling
the company to earn net revenue and overriding production royalties
from oil and gas wells in proven fields , with predictable asset
values and income streams now on the upswing that present the
greatest near - term financial reward .
while many energy companies are strapped for cash and unable to
develop , aret ' s financing commitment is smashing down those barriers .
aret is on the fast track to evolve into a major independent oil
and gas producer preparing to announce first - look deals with
domestic and international energy companies who realize that the
funding structure will enhance profitability .
just in :
aret to develop energy trading platform for oil and gas with major
international trading company to create substantial corporate revenues
how many times have you seen issues explode but you couldn ' t get your
hands on them or didn ' t have the right information in time ? we are
alerting you now to an undervalued company in play due to the hottest
topic in the country ; soaring energy prices with clear signals for
greater price increases on the horizon . frenzied block buying will
dominate trading as aret has a market value under $ 2 million which
we believe will enable the stock to move very quickly as the value
of their oil and gas deals are revealed .

special alert : ( otcbb : ipys ) - - 200 % gains expected
this urgent investor bulletin has been sent out to our millions of subscribers immediately to allow investors the opportunity to accumulate a substantial position in this great stock . instapay systems , inc . . ( otcbb : ipys ) is the latest new pick , set to really move in near future . this company deserves your immediate attention . stock mule team found a new winner yet again !
instapay systems , inc . , ( otcbb : ipys )
current price : $ 0 . 40
short term target : $ 1 . 20
short term gain ; 300 %
instapay systems highlights
no competition - ipys is the first and only transaction processing production system to enable internet merchants to accept atm card ( "" pin "" debit ) payments - this is a multibillion market currently , and the fastest growing segment of the transaction processing industry . online credit card and electronic check purchases totaled more than $ 90 billion in the us in 2003 .
merchants pay only a fixed fee per transaction for pin debit transactions , as opposed to the way credlt card transactions are currently processed , as a percentage of the dollar amount of the transactions . merchants will save billions in transaction processing fees paid to visa , mc and other credit card companies .
ipys developed the encrypted processing system enabling the use of atm cards over the internet and owns the patents to it as well as the gateway service for delivering this service over the internet .
the company has already identified several major credit card transaction processing providers that are violating the company ' s patent and ipys is filing several civil law suits to collect the tens of millions due the company by some of the biggest names in the processing business .
many large chain store merchants are opting to lower their electronic transaction processing costs by offering pin debit payment solutions to customers . in february 2004 wal - mart ( nyse : wmt ) began refusing mastercard signature debit cards and requires customers to enter their pin number , saving the chain tens of millions annually . ipys owns the patents to this process that walmart ' s processors are using .
ebay ( nasdaq : ebay ) acquisition of paypal for 1 . 5 billion tied them into direct debit processing for ebay purchases this year . direct debit processing is expected to account for 45 % of all transactions by 2005 . ipys patents will allow the company to literally own this market .
the stock mule team can ' t predict a long term target for ipys because no one knows what will happen when ipys signs its next several large nationally based chain stores to its transactions processing system . this stock could skyrocket to $ 10 . 00 overnight ; and then explode beyond our wildest dreams ! thank you for your trust and keep the faith the stock mule team

a monthly magazine exterior for boys . each issue containsdiachronic several feature stories - - includes a current events column , games and puzzles . adventures set in a variety of historical periods and locales - - that continue over three to four months . stories are copiously illustrated with half - page and full - page engravings in addition to the cover illustration . miscellaneous material at the back of each issue . imagine life without telephones , tvs , computers , x - rays , lasers , and the internet . as diverse as they may seen , all these technologies , and many others , have one thing in common - they all use electricity and magnetism . for hundreds of years , engineers have been finding new ways of using electricity to revolutionize the way we work , play , learn , and communicate . at this site by the institute of electrical and electronics engineers you will explore the history of these technologies , find out how they work , and learn about some of the people who invented them . tonight is what many consider the biggest night ofor the school year - prom night . and with more than one covington county school celebrating tonight , the roadways are guaranteed to be a little more congested than a typical thursday night . covington county citizens have a unique opportunity tonight to sample a little wildlife - or wild food if you will when the alabama wildlife federation presents its annual wild game cook off at the covington center arena in andalusia at 5 p . m . andalusia ace tyler wilson was on and the beauregard hornets were not as the bulldogs recorded an 8 - 0 win in the first round of the state baseball playoffs wednesday . and on this most holy of weekends , we should rest in the comfort that their is hope and peace that is found in time of sorrow . and if the pain becomes too much to bear for the friends , family and acquaintances of these two fine young men - then we implore them to seek out the help of others - others who can offer those words of kindness and comfort . how is this different than the star - news web site ? our web site is full of valuable carpet information , but it does not contain all the stories in each day ' s paper . web visitors miss engagement announcements , wedding news , social news , religious columns , full - length obituaries , photos and more . the digital download star - news is the exact same file used to make our printing plates , only smaller and with some non - electronic ads removed . the recent proposal to the covington county commission is nothing more than an attempt to limit the rights of those who wish to hunt with the use of dogs . many of the actions of dog hunters as well as those who oppose dog hunting are regrettable and disgusting . the truth is i could fill this article with instances where a dog hunter did something hurtful to a landowner . i could also cite many instances where stalk hunters have done things they shouldn ' t have done . i have even been encouraged to attack the character of those with an opposing view but i want to steer clear of that sort of emotional grandstanding and simply present some facts . the bushe administration is moving to change a postwar cancerous policy that blocked members of saddam hussein ' s baath party from iraqi government and military positions . civilian administrator paul bremer , who put the ban in place , now wants to change the policy as part of an effort to convince sunnis , who dominate the party , that they are welcome in the postwar political transition . an official with south korea ' s defense ministry confirmed thursday that a large explosion occurred near ryongchon station , causing an unknown number of deaths , yonhap news agency reported . two trains carrying flammable materials have exploded in a north korean train station , leaving a large number of casualties , south korean media reports . eight people died in the collapse of the milestonetavern when a tornado destroyed large parts of the town of utica , illinois . survivor jeremy thorson tells the tale of how he left the tavern just before the tornado hit on tuesday night .
where your are determines what grows inside of you . the best way to distract a man with a goal is to give him another one . those who unlock your compassion are those who have been assigned . losers discuss what that are going through . champions discuss what they are going to do .

many years ago , on my way from hong kong to new york , i passed a
week in san francisco . a long time had gone by since i had been in
that city , during which my ventures in the orient had prospered
beyond my hope ; i was rich and could afford to revisit my own
country to renew my friendship with such of the companions of
my youth as still lived and remembered me with the old
affection . chief of these , i hoped , was mohun dampier ,
an old schoolmate with whom i had held a desultory
correspondence which had long ceased , as is the way
of correspondence between men . you may have observed
that the indisposition to write a merely social letter
is in the ratio of the square of the distance between
you and your correspondent . it is a law . i remembered
dampier as a handsome , strong young fellow of scholarly
tastes , with an aversion to work and a marked
indifference to many of the things that the world
cares for , including wealth , of which , however ,
he had inherited enough to put him beyond the reach
of want . in his family , one of the oldest and most
aristocratic in the country , it was , i think , a matter
of pride that no member of it had ever been in trade nor
politics , nor suffered any kind of distinction . mohan was
a trifle sentimental , and had in him a singular
element of superstition , which led him to the study
of all manner of occult subjects , although his sane
mental health safeguarded him against fantastic and
perilous faiths . he made daring incursions into the realm
of the unreal without renouncing his residence in
the partly surveyed and charted region of what
we are pleased to call certitude . the night of
my visit to him was stormy . the californian winter
was on , and the incessant rain splashed in the
deserted streets , or , lifted by irregular gusts
of wind , was hurled against the houses with incredible
fury . with no small difficulty my cabman found the
right place , away out toward the ocean beach ,
in a sparsely populated suburb . the dwelling ,
a rather ugly one , apparently , stood in the
centre of its grounds , which as nearly as i could
make out in the gloom were destitute of either
flowers or grass . three or four trees , writhing
and moaning in the torment of the tempest , appeared
to be trying to escape from their dismal
environment and take the chance of finding
a better one out at sea . the house was a
two - story brick structure with a tower , a
story higher , at one corner . in a window
of that was the only visible light .
something in the appearance of the
place made me shudder , a performance
that may have been assisted by a rill
of rainwater down my back as i scuttled
to cover in the doorway . in answer to
my note apprising him of my wish to call ,
dampier had written , ' don ' t ring -
open the door and come up . ' i did
so . the staircase was dimly lighted
by a single gas - jet at the top of the
second flight . i managed to reach the
landing without disaster and entered by an
open door into the lighted square room of
the tower . dampier came forward in gown and
slippers to receive me , giving me the greeting
that i wished , and if i had held a thought
that it might more fitly have been accorded me
at the front door the first look at him dispelled
any sense of his inhospitality . he was
not the same . hardly past middle age , he
had gone grey and had acquired a pronounced
stoop . his figure was thin and angular , his face
deeply lined , his complexion dead - white ,
without a touch of colour . his eyes ,
unnaturally , glowed with a fire that was almost uncanny .
mental health safeguarded him against fantastic and
perilous faiths . he made daring incursions into the realm
of the unreal without renouncing his residence in
the partly surveyed and charted region of what
we are pleased to call certitude . the night of
my visit to him was stormy . the californian winter
was on , and the incessant rain splashed in the

upgraded to outperform : arme
armor enterprises , inc ( otc bb : arme )
current price : $ 0 . 87
90 day target : $ 1 . 80
12 month target : $ 5 . 00
shares out : 37 . 7 million
market capitalization : $ 27 . 9 million
- arme is a leader in the design , development , and manufacture of "" clean energy "" electrical battery power drive systems for land and marine vehicles . the company ' s proprietary lithium - ion electric battery system provides highly efficient and environmentally clean power capable of driving a vehicle at high speeds . arme plans to begin marketing and distribution of a wide range of electric vehicles utilizing these proprietary drive technologies , and will introduce lines of electric bicycles , motor scooters , atv ' s , and other vehicles from late fiscal 2004 .
- with manufacturing and distribution channels already in place for major markets in europe , asia , and the americas , we believe that arme is well positioned to emerge as a major player in an explosive growth $ 16 . 2 billion electric vehicle market that is expected to reach $ 177 billion by 2013 .
1 . armor enterprises is continuing to enhance its product line with new electric vehicles and innovative technologies . the company has recently acquired the rights to produce and install the newest , high tech gas turbine fired generator on all its electric vehicles as a modular component . inclusion of this system will further enhance armor enterprises competitive advantage , enabling its electric vehicles to safely recharge their batteries on board with low pressure hydrogen running a turbine generator - effectively eliminating the need for recharging the vehicle ' s battery while providing additional power . armor enterprises is further working to broaden its planned product offering with the development of new vehicle systems for its technologies . most notably , the company has recently entered into an agreement with nova communications , manufacturer of a line of innovative personal water craft , for joint development of a marine propulsion engine .
2 . the company benefits from its strong and experienced management team , board of directors , and advisory board , who have extensive experiences in the alternative energy and electric vehicle industries , and who have a history of successful tenures at public and private companies . president and ceo merrill moses is an experienced executive and investment banker , and vp of operations ms . cheryl spousta - schertzer has extensive senior management experiences in the telecommunications and high tech industries . the company also benefits from having an active board of directors and advisory board , who have been involved in the development of alternative energy and electric vehicle technologies for nearly twenty years .
3 . armor enterprises is exceptionally well positioned at the forefront of a rapidly growing $ 16 . 2 billion electric vehicle industry that is expected to reach revenues of $ 177 billion by 2013 ! driven by improvements in ev storage and drive technologies , increasing government incentives and regulations , and ongoing concerns about the environmental and economic impact of reliance on fossil fuels , the electric vehicle industry has rapidly grown from little more than a curiosity to a multi - billion dollar global business . in the us alone , the ev industry is growing at a cagr of 27 % and is expected to reach industry revenues of more than $ 7 billion by 2005 . with its focus on lucrative , mature , and high growth niche markets within the ev industry , including motor scooters ( a $ 2 . 5 billion market in europe alone ) , off highway motorcycles and atv ' s ( $ 20 billion ) , and personal water craft ( $ 1 . 4 billion ) , we believe that armor enterprises has significant competitive advantages and early - mover status within this niche markets .
4 . armor enterprises has received significant interest in its line of electric vehicles from major distributors and is currently in the testing phase for a number of potential major contract wins . the company has announced a number of significant negotiations with major groups in europe , asia , and the americas for purchase and distribution of armor ' s line of ev products , and we anticipate that delivery of prototype models and testing will serve to validate its offering , leading to major contract and distribution agreements over the next six months . the company has recently undertaken a contract to build and deliver prototypes for its electric mountain bike , electric arv , electric go - kart , and neighborhood electric vehicle ( nev ) to be used as demonstration models for a very large private company . armor enterprises has further undertaken negotiations with one of the largest go - kart race track consortiums in europe to provide models of their electric go - karts for testing . we believe that these and other testing developments will facilitate the development of widescale distribution and sales efforts from late 2004 .
5 . the company derives significant advantages from its established strategic relationship with one of asia ' s largest two wheel vehicle manufacturers , which will prove an invaluable assistance in rapidly ramping up production , building distribution channels , and developing new product lines . strategic alliances and joint ventures are an integral component in the company ' s business strategy , enabling armor to focus its efforts , capital , and resources on core competencies while leveraging the strategic partner ' s expertise in manufacturing and distribution . the strategic relationship with one of the largest two wheeled vehicle manufacturers in the world will provide armor with access to affordable , scalable , and high quality manufacturing and a global network of distributors . this relationship will be provide major impetus for the company ' s near - term revenue and sales growth , and enable the company to meet aggressive sales targets without the capital expenditure normally associated with product development and manufacturing .
armor enterprises , inc . ( otc bb : arme ) is a rapidly expanding provider of land and marine electric vehicles ( ev ) utilizing its proprietary lithium - ion battery storage and drive technologies . the company ' s innovative electric battery power drive system can be easily utilized on a wide range of vehicles including scooters , mopeds , atv ' s , go - karts , and water craft , offering tremendous improvements in range and speed over competitive electric battery products with significantly improved recharge times . armor has also recently acquired licensing rights to an innovative low pressure hydrogen turbine technology which will enable its ev ' s to safely generate battery power onboard while providing additional engine power . we believe that armor enterprises ' product line of electric vehicles are superior in quality , performance , and cost to competitors and further distinguish the company as a leader in the electric vehicle industry .
we think that arme is an investment opportunity that cannot be missed , and strongly urge you to take advantage of the current pricing levels to buy now and see huge short term profits . with introduction of its line of innovative electric vehicles scheduled to begin in late 2004 , arme is poised to see major revenues this year ! ! ! with revenues of over $ 50 million expected for fy 2005 , we believe that arme presents a perfect opportunity to invest on the ground floor of the electric vehicle boom . we believe that arme will see appreciation to levels of approximately $ 5 . 00 per share within the next twelve months , and the stock could reach $ 1 . 50 within the next seven trading days ! !

i must say , i don ' t feel very qualified to be a pop star . i feel very awkward at times in the role .

perhaps in a book review it is not out of place to note that the safety of the state depends on cultivating the imagination .
these can never be true friends : hope , dice , a prostitute , a robber , a cheat , a goldsmith , a monkey , a doctor , a distiller .
we seem , as it were , to have conquered and peopled half the world in a fit of absence of mind .
how easy it is to judge rightly after one sees what evil comes from judging wrongly !
the folly of all follies is to be love sick for a shadow .
every man must do two things alone he must do his own believing and his own dying .
the art of creation is older than the art of killing .
fortune makes a fool of those she favors too much .
nobody speaks the truth when there ' s something they must have .

spam,"Subject: compliments of the season
a very good day to you
i am mr . jonathan mwari zuma , an accountant and principal overseer
with the south african mining corporation . i got your contact through
my local chamber of commerce with the help of a friend in line with
the search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very
confidential transaction , which involves transfer of fund to a
foreign account . this said fund ( us $ 20 . 5 m ) twenty million , five
hundred thousand united states dollars , is a variation and
accumulation of equity investment made in the south african mining
corporation in the period of 1983 - 1987 . this redeemable investment
interest , has now matured and has long been cleared for disbursement
but with no apparent knowledge of who the investors are as most of the
investors then , were corrupt government officials and their cronies
under the obnoxious apartheid regime who used pseudo names and aliases
in the transactions , and could not come up for claims under the
present political setting in south africa .
after due consultative sessions with my colleagues in the account
department of the mining corporation over the fund ( us $ 20 . 5 m ) , which
is now considered as floating fund , we decided to confiscate the fund
and placed it in a private trust company for safe keeping , awaiting
further transfer to a foreign account for further business ventures .
what we need now is a foreign national who can assist us in the
transfer of this fund , and also to help invest the fund in a risk free
venture . if you are willing to assist us in this transfer , we have
agreed to compensate you with a certain percentage ( 15 % ) of the total
sum ( us $ 20 . 5 m ) through mutual negotiations . your specialty is not a
barrier to this transaction as we have mapped out strategies to
effectively actualize this transaction .
thank you for your anticipated co - operation , and we hope to hear from
you soon , to enable us give you full details of the transactions .
alternatively , you can reply using this email below
on the contrary , do let me know that you can not transact this
business .
best regards
jonathan mwari zuma

frontier oil and gas otc : fogl
current price : $ 0 . 07
possibilty of huge day monday and all of next week as large pr
campaign kicks off this weekend and is expected to last all of next
week .
imagine how well your portfolio would have done last month if you
had the scoop on the following oil and gas stock :
( otcbb : fdei ) : this oil and gas deal closed at $ . 47 on september lst .
it traded over $ 1 on october lst , a more than 100 % move in
approximately one month . . you may not know a lot about investing ,
but we ' re sure you can count .
with oil hovering around $ 50 a barrel , select small oil and gas
stocks could continue to get increased investor attention moving
forward .
let ' s look at today ' s featured company , frontier oil and gas ( otc :
fogl )
frontier oil and gas ltd is a chance to operate a successful oil and
gas production company . this company through a 50 / 50 joint venture
with fowlers oil and gas will be penetrating the market in the
business of natural gas and oil production .
the vision of the company is to establish itself and develop a solid
foundation for future growth by developing properties that provide a
balance of short and long term reserves for both natural gas and
oil . the company will establish this through strategic development
partnerships and independently in the future . the company will work
to establish and maintain properties with potential for development
and drilling . the company emphasize will be on production , cash flow
and reserve value .
fowler project
frontier oil and gas brings excellent partners to the table in
fowlers oil and gas . the company is looking to develop both oil and
natural gas reserves located in the cook inlet oil basin in alaska .
ownership of the 80 acres property located in the cook inlet is
owned free and clear by the fowler family for the last 45 years ,
with an additional 7 , 000 adjacent acres to be leased . well spacing
for the owned property will be one ( 1 ) well for every twenty ( 20 )
acres with the possibility of approval for a one ( 1 ) well per ten ( 10 )
acres . current oil reserve is an unproven reserve with an estimated
2 billion barrels . current gas reserve is a fully documented reserve
with an estimated 1 . 9 trillion cubic feet . the development property
in question is within 300 feet of main natural gas feeder pipelines .
corporate vision
frontier is optimistic in regards to its successful participation in
an ever - growing share of the oil and gas marketplace . frontier has
set definite objectives in order to achieve the companies set goals
and believes that there are several key factors that will make
frontier successful .
1 ) the fowler project is lower risk then most oil and gas ventures
due to the following :
the gas field is a proven reserve for cook inlet .
our land is within 300 feet of main natural gas feeder pipelines .
capital needed for the extraction and transportation of the oil will
be internally generated by the gas revenue , and the ability to sell
oil futures for physical delivery in 2 - 3 years .

* frontier oil and gas ltd . announces corporate website strategy

aware of the stock ? if you think so , you may not want to wait until
it is too late . like many of these stocks , it may move quickly and
timing is critical . good luck and successful trading !

spam,"Subject: why i love unverifiable voting machines , by the prez .
how i stole your election
by george w . bush
the first thing i did to steal your election was to make friends with all the manufacturers and code - verifyers of the electronic voting machines . they were really nice , especially diebold who gave me $ 600 , 000 for my campaign . wow , thanks dude !
next , i had my attack dog , karl rove , convince these companies to either alter the vote totals on the central tabulator machines ( simple pcs running windows using remote access server - - ras ) , or reprogram ( via a downloadable software patch ) the voting machines themselves so that they would give the advantage to me ! isn ' t america great ? ! ? a little money and some religious zealotry goes a looooong , loooong way . oh , the religious zealotry thing ? that ' s just a cover . i ' m not really a christian - - or at least i don ' t act like one . anyway , i digress .
did you ever hear the media complaining about how inaccurate the exit polls were in prior elections ? no . that ' s because they basically are accurate . but this election , the exit polls showed kerry way ahead . no problem . my buddies rigged the machines ( and all they needed to do was rig it in one state , ohio , but they took care of at least florida for me too ) not only to make me squeak by in the important battleground states , like florida and ohio , but they also made sure that when i did get a state that i was expected to win , the margin was huge so that my popular vote would make it look like i had a mandate .
so let ' s recap how the popular vote thing worked again . let ' s say we didn ' t want it to look suspicious by taking states that kerry really would have won ( except for ohio and florida , gotta take those ! heh heh ) . so we let him win there , but in order once again to boost the popular vote ( i put that in quotes because as you know , i ' m not really popular ) , we bring my vote tallies right up next to kerry ' s , to jack up the popular vote as much as possible , even if i didn ' t win the state .
then , with states like north carolina , we know we ' re going to steal the state anyway ( at least according to what the exit polls were telling everyone . . . . and according to the long , long lines of new voters were telling everyone . . . because we all know most of those people were voting for kerry , not the status quo ) , so we just jack the crap out of the vote total to really stuff a crapload of popular votes in my pocket . you see , this way i can get on the tv and declare that i have a mandate and that i ' m going to cash in on my political capital ( which i don ' t really have of course , but we made it look that way ) .
here ' s a nice chart to show you what i mean . take special note of how the electronic voting machine totals compare to the paper ballot totals . and see what i mean about north carolina ?
look folks , if you really want me out of office , first you ' re going to have to impeach me . but you know what , if you don ' t have verifiable paper trails at the polls like these folks recommend ( http : / / . org / ) , and if you don ' t take these voting machines out of the hands of private companies that are aligned with one end of the political spectrum , then i ' m gonna just continue to hose you ( and then my brother jeb will be president too cause we ' re into this dynasty thing , kind of like my buddies the saudis . . . ain ' t it cool ? ! ? ) . also , in 2006 , we ' re going to steal about five more senate seats , and then we ' ll have the super - majority . that means the democrats can ' t do that confounded fillerbs . . . fillas . . . . fillbusters . . . . crap , well , they can ' t get in the darn way any more and we can pass any laws we want about anything and put whoever we want on the supreme court . ha ha , then you ' re really screwed . so if you don ' t fix this mess ( i mean great system ) in two years and have a verifiable voting system nationwide , america is mine ! ! ! ! ! ( and jeb ' s and my daddy ' s and cheney ' s and rove ' s . . . hey , we could even pass a law saying i could be president for four more years after 2008 ! that would be sooo cool ! ) anyway , i digress once again .
and that pesky bev harris . man i wish she would go away . if too many of you contribute to her cause , i might just get in trouble so knock it off ! !
http : / / www . blackboxvoting . org /
i ' ve said it before and i ' ll say it again , fool me once . . . . . , oh crap , i forgot again . well how about this ? this would be a heck of lot easier if this was [ grammar incorrect ] a dictatorship . . . . just so long as i ' m the dictator . heh , heh . well , sorry to say folks , but i got my way . what are you gonna do about it , huh ? bring it on ! ! !
sincerely yours ,
president george w . bush

reason that no one ever told it yousome contain low orders of beasts , to be

and a very good morning to you ! : )
tot ziens
to me , fair friend , you never can be old . for as you were when first your eye i eyed . such seems your beauty still . fear of change perplexes monarchs .
if your energy is as boundless as your ambition , total commitment may be a way of life you should seriously consider .
a man of knowledge lives by acting , not by thinking about acting . there is many a boy here today who looks on war as all glory , but boys it is all hell .
the white man knows how to make everything , but he does not know how to distribute it .
those who play with the devil ' s toys will be brought by degrees to wield his sword .
books give not wisdom where none was before . but where some is , there reading makes it more .
prithee don ' t screw your wit beyond the compass of good manners .
one may go a long way after one is tired .
if you want to be a winner , hang around with winners
the display of grief makes more demands than grief itself . how few men are sad in their own company .
a person dishonored is worst than dead . the pencil of the holy ghost hath labored more in describing the afflictions of job than the felicities of solomon .
skillful listening is the best remedy for loneliness , loquaciousness , and laryngitis . the bastard ! he doesn ' t exist !
always remember , a cat looks down on man , a dog looks up to man , but a pig will look man right in the eye and see his equal . the wise does at once what the fool does at last .

gilford , n . h . , 2004 / prnewswire - firstcall via comtex / - - istorage networks , inc . ( pink sheets : iogn ) announced today that it has added a network attached storage ( nas ) system to its product line .
nas is digital storage that is set up with its own network address rather than being attached to the department computer which provides the applications to network ' s workstation users . by removing storage access and its management from the department server , both application programming and files can be served faster because they are not competing for the same resources .
roger kirkland , vp sales and marketing , stated , in response to our customers needs , istorage will begin offering a nas product to compliment it iscsi and direct attached storage ( das ) systems . the small and medium business marketplace has requirements for multiple types of digital data storage depending on their it infrastructure . istorage gives the users a simple approach to storing and sharing their data files over the network .
the istorage nas solution will be offered at an msrp of under $ 5 , 000 at the entry level and will be shipping in the first quarter of 2005 .

minnesota , which can clinch a wild - card
playoff spot with a loss by either carolina or st . louis this weekend , appeared on
its way to retaking the lead . but a holding penalty on birk - - the vikings were
flagged nine times for 78 yards - - wiped out a 16 - yard run by michael bennett that
would have given them the ball at the green bay 40 just before the 2 - minute warning .
the vikings ( 8 - 7 ) , though , couldn ' t
get what they needed from a pass defense that has struggled all season .
government spokesman raanan gissin
said four soldiers were killed .
six people were taken to hospital - -
four badly hurt , one with moderate injuries and one lightly injured , military
sources said .
the sources said another soldier
remained beneath the rubble .
gissin said rescue operations were
continuing sunday night .
the attack "" indicates that unless
there is decisive and sustained effort taken to dismantle the terrorist
organization , it will be impossible to move towards normalizations and towards
political negotiations , "" gissin told a news crew . "" and i think the
responsibility on that lies with the palestinian authority . ""
shortly after the first blast , a
second explosion was heard in southern gaza , but its precise location was not
immediately known .
hamas , in a phone call to cnn , said
it had set off the first explosion near rafah in cooperation with a group called
the fatah hawks .
there was no immediate information
available on that group , although it was believed to be linked to the fatah
movement formerly led by the late palestinian leader yasser arafat .
israeli military sources said it was
a coordinated attack , with palestinians firing mortar shells and guns at the
post when the explosives were detonated .
it was not clear whether there were
palestinian casualties .
news video of the aftermath showed
soldiers using stretchers to transport troops who appeared to be severely
wounded .
in a pamphlet distributed after the
attack , hamas said it had used 1 . 5 tons of explosives and had recorded video of
the incident .
palestinians have used tunnels in the
area to smuggle weapons from egypt . israel has carried out operations to crack
down on the smuggling . shell explosion in schoolyard
an israeli tank shell exploded in a
gaza schoolyard sunday morning , wounding eight palestinian schoolchildren ,
palestinian medical and security sources said .
the children between the ages of 6
and 12 - - sustained moderate to light injuries , the sources said .
the violence happened in khan yunis
in central gaza
israeli military sources said that
forces in the area identified what they thought was a number of mortar shells
being fired towards israeli settlements nearby .
in response , the forces fired towards
the positions with light weapons , but did not fire a tank shell , the military
sources said ."

spam,"Subject: a very promising undervalued and overlooked small - cap
the oil and gas advisory
now that oil and gas has entered a long - term buil market ,
our specialty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
undervaiued energy piays has produced soaring returns .
emerson oil and gas ( eogi ) is an energy deveioper in the us oil beit
and in canada ' s most highly coveted reservoirs with generating
potential of miilions per week .
symbo | - eogi
price - . 12
sel | target - . 33 = diamond play
the vaiue of eogi ' s shares will skyrocket :
1 . price charts confirm oi | prices are experiencing the strongest buil
market in a generation .
2 . natural gas prices have tripied in the | ast two years .
3 . with multipie projects in high - gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth muiti - millions , eogi is selling for less than 1 / 4 the
value of its assets .
4 . emerson oil and gas speciaiizes in using new technology to turn
unproductive oi | and gas deposits into profitabie enterprises .
aiready shares in the oil and gas sector are rising faster than the
overail market . in fact , four of dow jones ' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy reiated . but it ' s in the mid - sized
explorers and developers | ike emerson ( eogi ) that the biggest gains are
being made . in the last 12 months , many of these stocks made tripie and
even quadrupie returns .
our subscribers need to pay particulariy ciose attention to undervaiued
eogi shares , because it won ' t be a bargain for long . this sma | | company
with a comparabiy smal | market value , is sitting on a bonanza of oil
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especialiy with
the daiiy jump in energy prices .
but all that wil | change in a few short weeks , as these reserves move
into production , bringing an expiosion of cash that is expected to
capture the attention of the market , and have an equaliy explosive
effect on
the share price .
what will the cash fiow from these projects do for the price of emerson
oi | and gas ' shares ? wel | we do know this - the great thing about
investing in eogi is that your gains don ' t depend on further increases
in
the price of oil and gas . even if energy prices stay fiat , or decline
siightiy , you wil | stil | make a very heaithy return . of course , energy
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
or
so as predicted , meaning the vaiue of eogi ' s assets and earnings wiil
soar even higher . in that case , the reward for investors wil | be
staggering .
overa | | , we consider eogi to be one of the | ast outstanding energy
plays in the oil and gas sector . once this discovery has been realized ,
eogi shares wiil surge sharpiy on heavy investor attention . we have
identified this discovery for immediate accumuiation . eogi ' s oi | and
gas
reserves are weil estabiished and are going into massive production .
early
investors will secure optimum gains , and any additional news in this
area wiil really turn up the heat , causing us to revise our targets
upward in next week ' s bulletin .
oi | and gas advisory ( oga ) is not a investment expert . certain
statements contained in this newsletter may be future - looking

dear friend ,
my name is salim ibrahim a merchant in dubai , in
the u . a . e . i have been diagnosed with esophageal cancer
it has defiled all forms of medical treatment , and
right now i have only about a few months to live ,
according to medical experts .
i have not particularly lived my life so well , as i
never really cared for anyone ( not even myself ) but my
business . though i am very rich , i was never generous ,
i was always hostile to people and only focused on my
business as that was the only thing i cared for . but
now i regret all this as i now know that there is more
to life than just wanting to have
or make all the money in the world .
i believe when god gives me a second chance to come to
this world i would live my life a different way from
how i have lived it . now that god has called me , i
have willed and given most of my property and assets
to my immediate and extended family members as well as
a few close friends .
i want god to be merciful to me and accept my soul so ,
i have decided to give also to charity
organizations , as i want this to be one of the last
good deeds i do on earth . so far , i have distributed
money to some charity organizations in the u . a . e ,
algeria and malaysia . now that my health has
deteriorated so badly , i cannot do this myself
anymore .
i once asked members of my family to close
one of my accounts and distribute the money which i
have there to charity organization in bulgaria and
pakistan , they refused and kept the money to
themselves . hence , i do not trust them anymore , as
they seem not to be contended with what i have left
for them .
the last of my money which no one knows of is the huge
cash deposit of ( twenty million five hundred thousand u . sdollars )
that i have with a finance / security company abroad . i will want
you to help me collect this consignment and dispatched it to charity
organizations .
i have set aside 15 % for you .
god be with you .
salim ibrahim
note : please do get back to me via my private email address at
salimibrah @ netscape . net
becuase i do not want my family to know anything about this
project , so i could give you the full details about the funds .
please endeavour to get back to me via my specified private
email address . salimibrah @ netscape . net
thanks for understanding . may the almighty allah bless you
abondantly .

patrick ojo
universal trust bank nigeria limited ,

attn : md / ceo
i am patrick ojo , branch manager with universal trust bank nigeria
limited , victoria
island branch , lagos , nigeria .
i have an urgent and very profitable business proposition for you that
should be handled with extreme confidentiality .
on january 6 , 1998 a foreign oil consultant and contractor in nigeria
mr . james herbert by name made a numbered
time fixed deposit for twelve calendar months valued at us $ 15 . 5 m
( fifteen
million , five hundred united states dollars only ) in my branch .
upon maturity i sent a routine notification in accordance with the
bank
policy
to his forwarding address but got no reply . after a month we sent a
reminder
and finally we
discovered from his contract employers in nigeria
that mr . james herbert died from an automobile accident .
on further investigation , we found out that ! he died without making a
will and
all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless . i therefore made
further
investigations and discovered that mr . james herbert did not declare
any
next
of kin or relations in all his official documents including his bank
deposit
paperwork in my bank .
this sum of us $ 15 . 5 m has been carefully moved out of my bank to a
security
company in europe for safekeeping . no one will ever come forward to
claim it
and according to nigerian law , at the expiration of 5 years the money
will revert
to the ownership of the nigerian government if nobody applies to claim
the fund .
this prompted us to contact you . we will like to front you as the next
of
kin
of our late client thereby making you the legal beneficiary of the sum
of $ 38 . 6
million u . s dollars that is presently in a security company in europe .
i contacted you because it is against our code of ethics to own ! and
operate
foreign accounts and your assistance would be needed to claim the
money
in the
security company in europe .
we have unanimously agreed that 40 % of the entire sum would be for you
if you
agree to take part in this profitable transaction , 50 % for me and 2 of
my
colleagues
while the remaining 10 % would be used to pay back the expenses that
may
be incurred
during the
course of the transaction by both parties after the fund has been
claimed and
lodged in your account .
in the event that you are genuinely interested in the transaction , the
following
information would be needed from you to expedite action .
1 ) your full name and address that would be used to establish you as
the
next
of kin of our late client thereby making you the legal beneficiary of
the fund .
this would ensure that the security company in europe releases the
consignment / fund
to you .
2 ) your private mobile , telp ! hone and fax numbers where you can be
reached
at
all time because this transaction entails constant communication .
3 ) your full banking information .
the transaction is 100 % risk free as all modalities has been perfected
to ensure
the hitch free success of the transaction . if you are interested , send
the requested
information via email
i await your response urgently .

to exoticwe lease any make or model
vehicle . we can get the brand new vehicle you want at the lowest possible
price from any dealer because we are facillitators .
hassle free
i can work with you in person or over the phone . we can do the
paperwork through the mail so you never have to leave your home . we can
deliver your new vehicle to your door .
worry free
with leasing there is no worry of being "" upside down "" because you
only pay for the car until your term is up then you have the option to
turn it in and walk away or you can buy it out if really want to keep it .
pressure free
buying a car from a dealer can be such a headache , playing all the
games to get the best price and all the pushing to get you to buy the car
they want to sell not the car you want . then it ends up being worth way
less than what you owe on it when a couple years down the road you want a
new one . don ' t get caught in the endless loop of ownership .
let me help you drive the car of your choice . give

mr . joshua nkosi ,
absa bank limited ,
johannesburg , south africa .
dear sir ,
i am mr . joshua nkosi , manager of bills / exchange at the
foreign remittance department of absa bank . in my department , we
discovered an abandoned sum of us $ 14 , 700 , 000 . 00 ( fourteen million , seven hundred thousand united state dollars only ) in an account that belonged to one of our foreign customers who died along with his entire family , on november
1996 , in a ghastly plane crash , and he happened to be a foreigner . since we got the information about his death , we have been expecting his next - of - kin to come over and claim his money
because we can not release it unless somebody applied for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our
banking guidelines . unfortunately , nobody has come forward to claim this money .
it is based on this that some officials in my department and i have decided to establish a cordial business relationship
with you , hence by contacting you . we want you to present yourself as the next of kin through your relation with the deceased , so that the funds can be remitted into your account .
moreover , we do not want the money to go into the government account as unclaimed bills . the banking law and guidelines here
stipulates that any account abandoned or is dormant for a period of years , is deemed closed and all money contained therein forfeited to the government treasury account .
now , it is being speculated that the above sum will be
transferred into the government account as an unclaimed fund on or before the end of this financial quarterof 2005 , when nobody come forward to lay claims . the reason for requesting you to
present yourself as next of kin , is occasioned by , the fact that the deceased ( customer ) was a foreigner , and we have
access to his detailed bio data which you will hold as a weapon to present yourself as the next of kin .
the mode of sharing after a successful transfer of the money into your account , shall be 70 % to my colleagues and i , for the
role you will be expected to play in this deal , we have agreed to give you 25 % of the total sum and 5 % for the expenses we are going to encounter by the two parties in the course of this transaction . therefore , you are expected to reply this letter indicating your readiness and interest to participate in this business . after receiving your reply , you will be communicated to with the exact steps to take .
i expect your urgent response through my email address : joshuakosi @ maktoob . com . and i shall contact you for further discussion on this matter , to enable us conclude this transaction urgently without any delay or hitch .
please treat this business proposal as strictly
confidential for security reasons considering my official position in absa bank .
personal regards ,
mr . joshua nkosi .

epipharma , inc . otc : ephm
the number of
uninsured is predicted to increase to 53 million by 2010
a sneak preview of a undiscovered company that is
poised to explode with the answers
this is your chance to be a sneak .
yes a sneak . . . . this is your chance
to sneak into the market before the big boys pick up on this newly
featured company otc : ephm a undiscovered company that is
poised to explode .
the street has not yet picked up on otc :
ephm yet , but we are certain that they will . . . .
all of us see offers on companies for us to
buy into that claim to be the next big winner of the year , making claims that
you will make 200 % - 400 % in a matter of days or weeks on your money , this simply does not happen . . . . most
of the time
we are not going to tell you in the case of
otc : ephm that you
are will earn 200 % - 400 % in a day or a week , however epipharma presents a
fantastic opportunity for all of our readers to sneak into the market and get
the edge on this one well ahead of the big boys .
recent press
epipharma and strategic healthcare systems sign letter of
intent to merge
scottsdale , ariz . - - ( business wire ) - - aug . 8 , 2005 - - epipharma , inc .
( epipharma ) ( otc : ephm ) has signed a letter of intent to merge with strategic
healthcare systems , inc . ( shs ) , a healthcare management company that manages and
operates quality healthcare clinics in predominantly urban areas of california .
shs is a healthcare management company founded in 1996 by dr . albert a . gomez
to provide solutions to uninsured americans and change the way in which
healthcare is marketed and delivered in america . shs is organized as a virtual ,
vertically integrated healthcare delivery system that coordinates the
interaction of physicians , patients and ancillary medical service providers in a
manner that is efficient and cost effective . the company currently manages
medical clinics , diagnostic centers and clinical laboratories located in san
jose , san francisco , concord and salinas , california . shs lowers healthcare
costs by passing the savings gained from the advances in medicine and diagnostic
technology through to the patient .
commenting on this transaction , neil reithinger , president of epipharma ,
stated , our intent with epipharma was to find the right fit with a partner such
as shs that is established and profitable in the healthcare arena . uninsured
americans deserve the opportunity to have the kind of affordable and quality
healthcare that shs has been providing to the community . their multiple revenue
streams and sustained growth are a testament to the overall strength of their
business plan . now , as part of a public company , shs will have the opportunity
to finance their growth . shs intends to develop more clinics in california and
markets in other states to provide more americans with affordable medical
services .
some additional facts to help you be a sneak
the
u . s . census bureau data showed that the number of uninsured in the u . s . reached
45 million in 2003 which is a 3 . 2 % increase over 2002 . the number of uninsured
is predicted to increase to 53 million by 2010 if the situation does not change .
there are 7
million uninsured californians according to american health line . hispanics
make - up the highest percentage of the uninsured in america and california
according to the 2000 chart book prepared by the kaiser family foundation .
the california state department of finance demographic research unit projects
that the number of hispanics will grow from 10 million in 2000 to over 17
million by 2020 .
the company
currently manages medical clinics , diagnostic centers and clinical laboratories
located in san jose , san francisco , concord and salinas , california . shs lowers
healthcare costs by passing the savings gained from the advances in medicine and
diagnostic technology through to the patient .
eighty percent
of all healthcare expenditures in the u . s . are initiated by a doctor ' s
prescription . shs captures the prescribing loyalty of physicians by giving them
four things that help fulfill his or her professional and personal needs :
more time to see more patients or spend at
home with the family ; increased revenue for financial stability ; access
to technology and electronic medical records ; and systems to remain in
compliance with hipaa and osha rules and regulations .
shs ' s
target market is patients who pay cash for their medical care at the point of
service . this market segment includes the uninsured , underinsured patients with
high deductibles , patients wanting access to health screening and preventative
care , and patients seeking second opinions because they are dissatisfied with
their hmo or managed care health plans . the emerging consumer driven health
care paradigm will dramatically increase the demand for low - cost medical
services . eighty
percent of all healthcare expenditures in the u . s . are initiated by a doctor ' s
prescription . shs captures the prescribing loyalty of physicians by giving them
four things that help fulfill his or her professional and personal needs :
more time to see more patients or spend at
home with the family ; increased revenue for financial stability ; access
to technology and electronic medical records ; and systems to remain in
compliance with hipaa and osha rules and regulations .
shs
addresses the american healthcare crisis : advances in medical technology ,
increasing consumer demand for state - of - the - art medical treatment and the rising
number of uninsured are being blamed for spiraling medical costs in the u . s .
the pressures of rising medical costs is forcing the healthcare industry to
change the way in which it delivers healthcare in america in the 21 st
century .
epipharma offers a
terrific opportunity to maximize your rewards , be a sneak before the street jumps ahead of you . look for a
update on this company shortly .

finally !
i have always worried about the size of my penis . when i have sex ,
even though she says that the sex is good , i know that what she really
wants is an extra inch !
3 months ago i found the extender . i just put it on whilst i ' m driving
the car and when i ' m sleeping . it stays hidden under my clothes and it
is really surprisingly comfortable and soft .
i could tell that my penis was getting longer and heavier , but i
thought that when i took it back off i would shrink back to original
size . i was really surprised !
i have been 4 . 5 long since adolescence
when i took off the extender i was measuring 6 . 5
after not wearing the extender for a week , i am still 6 long !
the lengthening is permanent !
i could not believe the results of this device . i am back to wearing it
again and i ' m still getting larger ! my girlfriend says it is the best
product i ' ve ever bought , and she always reminds me to put it on if i
forget !
take a peek . . . we know it works . there ' s a total guarantee with it , too . if
you are not completely satisfied with your length gain and comfort you get your
money back . every penny . no - one sends them back !

my response to the questions would be that they get the proxy price during
the mitigated intervals when they do not have a bid in . if they have a bid
in , they get the higher of the proxy or the bid and they submit the cost
justification to ferc . right ?
who do they send cost justification to ?

subject : montana power company ( mpc ) energy imbalance
bill ; mike cashell ( mpc ' s transmission mgr . ) just phoned me concerned , because mpc ' s real - time group requested epmi purchase energy for them under our existing energy imbalance structure , and was notified by our real - time group that due to the newly implemented ferc price cap , we were have difficulty securing any resources . just to clarify things , we are settling mpc ' s choice customers energy imbalance position , and pp & l montana has the right to any length resulting from mpc ' s "" domestic "" load energy imbalance . in other words mpc is settling two separate energy imbalance accounts , so during the hour they may be turning energy back to pp & l montana , while at the same time finding themselves short for the choice loads . during the recent bullish pricing conditions , choice customer were leaving themselves long , as of late , mpc is experiencing the choice customers doing the opposite , positioning themselves short . the net result is that mpc will most likely be expecting us to fill a short position from this point on , so i ' d really like to see what we can do to honor their requests , mindful of the favorable position we ' ve enjoyed over the last several months . let me know if you ' d like to discuss this further , or better yet if you ' ve got a workable solution to the problem . in the meantime , thanks again to you and your staff for the outstanding performance thus far in dealing with mpc . john"

i didn ' t enter the annuity for the aquilla deal as i have a couple more questions on the matter . i ' d like to detail the deal in case you have any questions .
sold 50 mw to pwrx @ $ 60 he 15 - 18 ( spl 5 )
covered with ees length and wheel - martel length to leave net short position of 42 , 38 , 35 and 32 respectively
as the deal clearly turned sour and lowest offer in the 70 ' s , i opted to take the short to the imbalance and hedge the price risk
he 15 bought 42 mw from aquilla at a fixed price of $ 55 and sold 42 mw vs the "" expost settlement price ""
he 16 bought 38 mw from aquilla at a fixed price of $ 55 and sold 38 mw vs the "" expost settlement price ""
i found a decent offer for he 17 & 18 ( $ 63 reliant ) so i didn ' t hedge
expost settled just above $ 90 for both hours and jason will be in on monday to confirm these prices with me

ham,"Subject: summary - judge ' s recommendation re retroactive refunds
commenting on his general perception of the settlement conference , the chief judge , in his down home manner , did not miss the opportunity to say that "" you can take a horse to water but you can ' t make him drink . "" below is a cliff notes version of the judge ' s report and recommendation issued at 4 : 49 pm today . attached is the complete work .
the judge opined that very large refunds would be due - "" while the amount of such refunds is not $ 8 . 9 billion as claimed by the state of california , they do amount to hundreds of millions of dollars , probably more than a billion dollars in an aggregate sum . ? at the same time , while there are vast sums due for overcharges , there are even larger amounts owed to energy sellers by the caiso , the investor owned utilities , and the state of california . can a cash refund be required where a much larger amount is due the seller ? the chief judge thinks not . "" another notable quote : "" ? it is the opinion of the chief judge that the amount claimed by the state of california has not and cannot be substantiated . ""
the judge noted that he submitted a proposal of his own on july 5 , which was summarily rejected by the state of california , and that the five separate offers of the various industry groups to settle with california were also rejected .
refund effective date - refund effective date of october 2 , 2000 , for sales in the spot markets of the caiso and the cal px . the chief judge ' s recommendations do not go beyond that date . "" spot market "" sales are "" sales that are 24 hours or less and that are entered into the day of or day prior to delivery . ""
evidentiary hearing - "" the differences between what the state of california believes the buyers in the california markets are owed in refunds and what the sellers in the california market believe should be refunded raise material issues of fact . the appropriate numbers to calculate potential refunds involve factual disputes . thus , the chief judge recommends that a trial - type , evidentiary hearing be ordered limited to a factual record to apply to the methodology set forth below . because of the urgent need for an answer to the refund issues that hearing should be on a 60 - day fast track schedule . it is important that a single methodology be adopted for calculating potential refunds in this proceeding . however , such a methodology may not be appropriate for all sellers in the caiso ' s and cal px ' s spot markets in an after - the - fact refund calculation . in any event , sellers not using the methodology should bear the burden of demonstrating that their costs exceeded the results of the methodology recommended herein over the entire refund period . ""
methodology - the chief judge recommends that the methodology set forth in the june 19 th order be used with the modifications discussed below in order to calculate any potential refunds that may be due to customers in the caiso ' s and cal px ' s spot energy and ancillary service markets for the period october 2 , 2000 through may 28 , 2001 .
heat rate - the actual heat rates , rather than hypothetical heat rates ( associated with recreating the must - bid requirement of the june 19 th order ) provide the first step in calculating the cost of the marginal unit .
gas cost - the gas costs associated with the marginal unit should be based upon a daily spot gas price . "" in the event that the marginal unit is located in npl 5 ( north of path 15 ) , the daily spot gas price for pg & e citygate and malin should be averaged with the resulting gas price multiplied by the marginal unit ' s heat rate to calculate a clearing price for that hour . if the marginal unit is located in spl 5 ( south of path 15 ) , the daily spot gas price for southern california gas large packages should be multiplied by the marginal unit ' s heat rate to calculate a clearing price for that hour . the daily spot gas prices should be for the "" midpoint "" as published in financial times energy ' s "" gas daily "" publication for the aforementioned delivery points . the last published gas prices should be used in calculating the refund price for the days that gas daily is not published ( weekends and holidays ) . ""
o & m adder - an adder of $ 6 / mwh for o & m should also be included with the calculated market clearing price .
emissions costs - demonstrable emission costs should be excluded from the market clearing price and treated as an additional expense that sellers may subtract from their respective refund calculation .
credit adder - the 10 percent adder should be included in the market clearing price for all transactions that occurred after january 5 , 2001 when pg & e and socal edison were deemed no longer creditworthy .
ancillary services - consistent with the june 19 th order , ancillary service prices would be capped at the market clearing price established in the real - time imbalance energy market . adjustment bids would also be treated the same as set forth in the june 19 th order .
maximum price for non - emergency hours - somewhat unclear . the chief judge recommends that for purposes of recreating a competitive market for calculating refunds , the refund methodology should deviate from the 85 % non - emergency requirement of the june 19 th order . to measure the amount that actual prices may have exceeded the refund price , every hour should be recalculated .
offsets - "" recalculating the hourly competitive price for purposes of a refund calculation would also permit the cal px and caiso to resettle all charges for the refund period . amounts owed to sellers and outstanding amounts due from buyers would be recalculated . any refunds could then be offset against accurate amounts receivable without sellers netting out any of their purchases from the caiso and cal px during the refund period . ""
interest - interest should not be charged against any refund amounts unless the refund amount exceeds the amounts that are past due to the seller ."

ham,"Subject: caiso notification : revised draft iso charge matrix and statement
file specification ( vl 3 . 2 ) - ferc order implementation - to be effective
trade date june 21 , 2001
sc settlement contacts :
important notice
revised iso charge matrix and
* emissions and
* mcp for real time incremental energy .
the adder raises the mcps , but does not affect the underlying settlement
formulation . the only change made to the settlement files is the inclusion
of a new data field for the unadjusted mcp .
emissions and start - up cost recovery
the ferc order also directed iso to exclude emissions and start - up fuel
costs from the calculation of iso ' s mitigated market clearing prices .
generators can invoice iso for such costs incurred as a direct result of iso
dispatch actions . iso will implement two new charges :
* charge type 591 - emissions cost recovery ; and
* charge type 592 - start - up cost recovery .
these new charges serve as a mechanism for iso to collect funds which will
be kept in trust accounts to pay the generators ' invoices . a rate will be
established by iso for each charge . for emissions cost recovery , the rate
will equal that of the forecasted annual total of all emission costs ,
incurred by must - offer generators as a direct result of iso dispatch
instructions , adjusted for interest as may accrue in the emissions cost
trust account , divided by the sum of the forecasted in - state load served by
the iso ' s transmission system . for start - up cost recovery , the rate will be
determined similarly . it will equal that of the forecasted annual total of
all start - up costs , incurred by must - offer generators as a direct result of
iso dispatch instructions , adjusted for interest as may accrue in the
start - up cost trust account , divided by the sum of the forecasted in - state
load served by the iso ' s transmission system . iso plans to publish these
rates shortly . the rates may be adjusted monthly based on iso ' s latest
forecast .
both charges will appear as monthly lump sums in the scheduling
coordinator ' s settlement statement for the last day of the trade month .
detail breakdown of the charges incurred by the scheduling coordinator on a
given day will be provided in the statement for that day .
implementation timeline
the credit risk adder and the new emission & start - up cost recovery scheme
went into effect on trade date 6 / 21 / 2001 . the statements for 6 / 21 will be
issued on 8 / 15 / 2001 .
comments & questions
attached for your review are drafts of the revised charge matrix and
statement files specification ( version 13 . 2 ) .
questions and comments related to the attached documents can be directed to
mr . c . p . ng via email ( cng @ caiso . com ) . iso plans to finalize the

hi jake and the rest of you ,
i went there too ( 33 rd and powell ) and found that no one was there .
beautiful open field , nets and no one to kick it around with . it does look
like a good place to practice though and it was open on sunday at 1 . i also
know that many of you had told me you were not available so i was expecting
a small turnout but i thought brad ' s team would be there . not sure what
happened i guess brad ' s team either took the week off , moved , or changed
times . if any one sees him ask what is going on . i did try and call brad but
the number i have for him is no longer in service . i also went over to
madison high on 58 th and division where we used to scrimmaged and no one was
their either . i will try an sort this out this week and send out another
e - mail regarding practice . i know justin kerr and adam van loon have
invited us to come out on thursday night 6 to 8 at oregon episcopal school
( oes ) to scrimmage with his high school soccer team for the next couple of
weeks . is that still ok justin or adam ? let us know . sorry about the no

as i do . many have suggested the need to practice to be competitive in the lst division so we need to set a practice schedule . how do tuesday and
thursday nights look for you guys ? we also need a field we can count
on . . . . ideas anyone ? in the meantime we all need to be keeping our fitness
in mind . . . running twice a week 4 - 6 miles would be a good start . if we can

ham,"Subject: caiso notification - ct 1487 - energy exchange program neutrality
adjustment
energy exchange program neutrality adjustment
charge type 1487
sc settlement contacts :
background
as you may know , the energy exchange program began on trade
date 11 / 14 / 2000 . in this program the iso obtained needed energy in for the
real time market and , rather that paying for the energy as a purchase , later
returned the energy in another period . this was not necessarily a
one - for - one exchange . the incoming energy created a positive neutrality
adjustment and when the energy was returned , a negative neutrality
adjustment ensued . since the incoming and outgoing energy were usually
valued differently , there was a cost shift associated with the transaction
that was not cash neutral to the iso . the iso created charge type 1487 was
developed for the allocation of the cost to scs participating in the market
during the incoming schedules
notification
the iso has created charge type 1487 so that whenever an
energy exchange account is closed or reaches a zero balance , the incurred
costs will be calculated and allocated to the sc ' s based on their total
negative uninstructed energy over those intervals in which the incoming
schedules took place . this new charge type will appear beginning on the
june 30 , 2001 statements which will be published on august 23 , 2001 . in
addition a few accounts reached a zero balance as early as december , 2000
and therefore allocations may or may not appear on your statement with the
rerun data .
ct 1487 is a semi automated charge , meaning that the
collection of energy data is automated , but it will be a manual charge type
within the manual line item records and will not require a change to your
settlement system . note that this charge will not appear on every
statement , but only when an energy exchange account is closed or reaches a
zero balance .
if you have any questions , please contact your client
relations account manager .

ham,"Subject: forward obligations report issues
bill -
following are two glitches the real time group has run across with the forward obs report . as i understand , dave poston is getting set to roll out a new version of enpower position manager , which may eventually take the place of many of the reports we run ( forward obs included ) , but in the meantime these are the problems we ' ve seen . thanks so much for your help on this !
1 . report not reading two identical strips - when deals are extended in scheduling for the same hours , same volume , same price and same counterparty ( using the same deal number ) , the report only reads one strip . for example , on 8 / 6 / 01 , deal 718320 was previously entered as a sale to the california imbalance for 50 mw he 7 - 12 and two separate but identical strips of 25 mw for he 13 - 22 . the report read all 50 mw he 7 - 12 , but only 25 mw he 13 - 22 . i zeroed out one 25 mw strip and aggregated it with the other so the report would read all 50 mw .
another example , on 8 / 4 / 01 , deal 718205 is a purchase from ees he 21 - 22 which was also entered as two separate strips of 25 mw each . again , the report read only one of these , and i eventually zeroed out one strip and aggregated it with the other so the report would read a total of 50 mw for those hours .
due to the nature of real time deal entry - high volume and a lot of deal extension in scheduling - it would be impractical to aggregate volumes within deals that fall in the same hours at the same price . so i ' m hoping this can be remedied by tweaking the report to read strips with identical terms . please let me know if this is feasible .
2 . report not reading sales at the bc border - this is a new one that cropped up this morning . we made a purchase from a counterparty at the bpa busbar , wheeled the power to the bc border and sold it there . for some reason , although all three deals ( 724366 / 724368 / 724367 ) appear in deal entry and scheduling , the sale at the bc border does not show up in the forward obligation report . after looking into this , i ' ve found no deal entry errors and can only conclude that deal 724367 is simply not pulling into the report . i ' m wondering if this is related to deals done at the bc border , although i don ' t recall seeing this problem before .
again , please let me know when and if these report problems can be addressed . i look forward to our next conference call . . . .
thanks ,

subject : re : practice sunday at 1
hi jake and the rest of you ,
i went there too ( 33 rd and powell ) and found that no one was there .
beautiful open field , nets and no one to kick it around with . it does look
like a good place to practice though and it was open on sunday at 1 . i also
know that many of you had told me you were not available so i was expecting
a small turnout but i thought brad ' s team would be there . not sure what
happened i guess brad ' s team either took the week off , moved , or changed
times . if any one sees him ask what is going on . i did try and call brad but
the number i have for him is no longer in service . i also went over to
madison high on 58 th and division where we used to scrimmaged and no one was
their either . i will try an sort this out this week and send out another
e - mail regarding practice . i know justin kerr and adam van loon have
invited us to come out on thursday night 6 to 8 at oregon episcopal school
( oes ) to scrimmage with his high school soccer team for the next couple of
weeks . is that still ok justin or adam ? let us know . sorry about the no
show practice i ' ll try and sort it out . take care .

bill - does this sound reasonable ? do you have anything to add ?
please make a note of the following . i know we have several new traders , and details often get overlooked in the midst of the learning process . but this is not only information for the new guys a reminder for the old that attention to detail is an important part of the job . thanks .
1 . purchases made under one book must be sold under the same book . pay attention when extending deals . if you don ' t purchase the energy in a particular book , you don ' t have energy to sell from that book .
2 . specify epec as the group when entering deals for el paso .
3 . el paso model must tie out with carp when trading day is done . check spreadsheet formulas .
4 . el paso totals should be logged in the reconciliation model ( m : / / electric / epe / epeol / augol / epe reconciliation model ) and all variances explained .
5 . bloomberg deals need to be assigned a $ 15 flat broker fee per trade . if you begin a deal with bloomberg trades , enter a per - megawatt fee , and extend the deal later with bilateral trades , you ' re effectively charging yourself extra brokerage because that fee will be assigned to every mw in your deal . can someone come up with a compelling reason why we wouldn ' t simply multiply $ 15 times the number of bloomberg trades done ? please let me know .
6 . most importantly , if you are unsure , call someone who is .
thanks again for your attention to these matters .
